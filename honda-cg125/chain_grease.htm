          Motorcycle Chain Grease Review
        </h1>
        <p>
          The only manufacturer that I have managed to find that make Motorcycle Chain Grease is.<br />
          Putoline Chain Wax 1kg<br />
          <img alt="" height="122" src="images/putoline_chain_wax.jpg" style="float: left" width="162" />
        </p>
        <p class="down-30px">
          Despite its name, it is the traditional motorcycle chain grease (not the wax chain lube in a spray can).<br />
          Big metal tin (24cm by 7.5cm), that has solid grease (wax); heat up the tin,<br />
          the grease melts and penetrates deep in to the chain.
        </p>
        <p class="under-img">
          It's still by far the best way to lubricate a chain (according to everyone I speak to including mechanics),<br />
          saving you not only a fortune in new chains and sprockets<br />
          (chain and sprockets will last much, much, much, much longer),<br />
          but also keeps the chain in a near new condition,<br />
          so resistance does not build up anywhere near as much (more power at back wheel).
        </p>
        <p>
          Chain grease was used by the majority of motorcyclists in the past, but as you will see in this article,<br />
          not only is it still far superior to the modern ways, reducing the amount of power loss from the engine,<br />
          but also saves you a fortune in chains and sprockets.
        </p>
        <p>
          The true stories I keep hearing from people and mechanics,<br />
          of it making the chain and sprockets last 3 or 4 times longer than not using grease is endless.<br />
          This is due to the grease keeping the chain resistance low, so wear is substantially reduced and stays reduced,<br />
          since chains wear out sprockets they also last much longer.<br />
          I even hear true stories of severely neglected chains that have done high mileages, seized up and stretched a lot,<br />
          put it in the grease and it comes out nearly like new<br />
          and near the length it was when new (you will see why later on in this article).
        </p>
        <p>
          Most Putoline motorcycle dealers do not stock this item, they can order it from Putoline if they wish,<br />
          or you can buy it on the internet, search for Putoline Chain Wax 1kg,<br />
          the 1kg bit is important since you do not want wax chain lube in a spray can (which is totally different, more like chain oil!).<br />
          For some strange reason, it's in the Putoline off road motorcycle section,<br />
          even though it's for road bikes as well as off road bikes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Chain grease cannot be used on O, X or Z ring chains, since it would melt the rubber of the rings.<br />
          But as you will find out, later on in this page, O, X and Z rings are very expensive and are not as good as a chain with grease!
        </p>
        <p>
          The chain grease can be used over and over again (since it uses very little grease per chain),<br />
          so one tin will last a very long time, it will also not really age so will be good for many, many years.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Chain types, lubrication methods, downsides and History
        </h2>
        <p>
          The chances are if you are under 50 years old, you have never heard of Motorcycle Chain Grease.<br />
          If you are over 50 years old and were motorcycling in your youth, you have probably used it and know everything about it.
        </p>
        <p>
          To bring everyone up to date, in the modern world of Motorcycle Chains.<br />
          Motorcycle Chain Grease started to die off when O ring chains started to become common.
        </p>
        <p>
          All chains are basically the same, when manufactured they have grease inside.<br />
          With a traditional chain (non O, X or Z ring), the grease inside is not protected,<br />
          so over time it is pushed / washed out and dirt and grit gets inside it.<br />
          That's why you have to use Motorcycle Chain Grease to clean and put grease back inside the chain<br />
          (or buy a new chain regularly = expensive!).
        </p>
        <p>
          Someone came up with the idea to seal the chain with rubber seals (O rings);<br />
          this means every link in the chain has to have a seal.<br />
          The biggest problem with having to seal every link in the chain is it's very expensive, seals also have a failure rate,<br />
          O ring failures are far too high for my and many others liking and chain warrantees<br />
          are often useless (even the best brand names), even on a chain that's only a few days old,<br />
          they often blame the user for the failed chain (it's hard to prove if the chains to blame or the user).
        </p>
        <p>
          O rings also have another big problem, they create a lot of resistance, reducing engine power, X rings are better.<br />
          You will never find a race bike or off road race bike with an O, X, Z or any other form of sealed chain they invent in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe O rings were invented for off road endurance use.<br />
          This is when the off road motorcycle has to travel very large distances in terrible conditions.<br />
          With sand, dirt, grit and water constantly being fired in to the chain, in incredible quantities for very long distances and time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to the down sides of O rings, they never took off on normal motorcycles.<br />
          But as road motorcycles became more and more powerful, they hit a problem.<br />
          Motorcycle chains use a single clip link, this means you can just unclip it and the chain will split in two,<br />
          so you can easily remove the chain.<br />
          Put it in chain grease then put it back on etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          But over the years, high end road motorcycle engines became more and more powerful;<br />
          eventually the clip link could not stand the power and would break.<br />
          The only answer was not to use a clip link,<br />
          but to use a rivet link, a rivet link is very hard to install, impossible to re-use and hard to remove.<br />
          Not being able to put a rivet linked chain in to chain grease was a major problem,<br />
          since chain lube (chain oil, chain wax spray can etc.)<br />
          does not lubricate the chain properly on its own (without chain grease as well).<br />
          They had to use O ring chains, to keep the original grease inside the chain.
        </p>
        <p>
          Originally O ring chains where only on road bikes that had too much power for a clip link (excluding racing bikes).<br />
          But over the years they have been filtering down to less powerful engines, even the slowest 125cc engines.
        </p>
        <p>
          Race bikes, off road race bikes and high end road sports bikes<br />
          as mentioned before will not use any type of sealed chain (O, X, Z etc.).<br />
          Since the resistance in the seals reduces the engine power far too much for their highly competitive sport.<br />
          Due to their engines high power output,<br />
          they either use a rivet link or the chain is actually manufactured with no split in the chain (so it's endless).<br />
          With rivet linked chains, they normally throw the chain away after each race (with the tyres as well).<br />
          The non-split chain means they have to part disassemble the bike to get it off and then they put a new on.<br />
          Race people have very experienced mechanics and spend a fortune in parts and labour for every race!
        </p>
        <p>
          All chains are made in standard sizes.<br />
          Nearly all motorcycle are size 428, 520, 525 or 530.<br />
          The 428 and 520 size chains can be bought in O ring, X (may be Z) ring and non-sealed form.<br />
          Any type of 428 size chain can be used on a bike that uses a 428 size;<br />
          the same applies to 520, 525, 530 or any other sizes that exist.<br />
          For example a bike that's supplied with a 428 O ring, can have a non sealed chain or X ring etc. fitted in its place.<br />
          Non sealed chains normally have a clip link, O and X ring often insist on rivet link.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can often tell if a chain is O, X or Z ring by looking at the chain rollers<br />
          (that's the part of the chain that touches the back wheel sprocket).<br />
          With a torch or a decent amount of daylight, look at where the rollers touch the sides of the chain,<br />
          if you can see anything between like little black things,<br />
          that's probably rubber seals (may need a magnifying glass to be sure),<br />
          keeping the grease inside the rollers, if a roller moves up and down excessively or to easily, the seal is broken for sure.<br />
          You can always look at a high powered motorcycle (not a race bike or high end sports bike) for reference,<br />
          since its chain will be O, X or Z ring for sure and since chain is really big will be easier to see what I mean.

        <h2>
          How to use Chain Grease (Putoline Chain WAX)
        </h2>
        <p>
          The method has not changed since the invention of Chain Grease.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remove chain from the bike.<br />
          The easiest way to do this is:<br />
          Rotate back wheel until the chains clip link is at the bottom and in the middle (so you can easily get to it).<br />
          Unclip it (so chain splits in to two).<br />
          Attach an old chain to it (or a new one).<br />
          Rotate back wheel until your chain comes off completely.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may wish to clean your chain before putting it in the grease,<br />
          but the grease is designed to also clean the chain (but grease will get dirty).<br />
          To clean the chain, you can use Paraffin or Kerosene (from good Hardware stores),<br />
          Diesel (use thick rubber gloves) or Petrol (petrol is very flammable!).
        </p>
        <p>
          Remove Chain Grease lid and put chain on top of grease.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will need to be able to remove a very hot chain from very hot grease,<br />
          so put something like a metal coat hanger through one end of the chain, so you can pull chain out easily.
        </p>
        <p>
          Put the grease's metal tin on top of a heat source like a cookers hob to melt the grease (chain will fall in to melting grease).<br />
          Warning, many people will not like the smell of melting grease (melting wax) in the house,<br />
          so often a small camping burner (hob) is used outside (little cheap thing from a camping shop),<br />
          make sure grease tin does not fall off when wax is melted (creates a mess).<br />
          I suppose you could even use a barbeque if you wanted.<br />
          If you do melt the grease in the house, try to have all the windows open, an extractor fan at full power,<br />
          the doors closed and do it at a time that will not affect others and give the room several hours for the smell to disappear.<br />
          That's all probably a bit over the top, but in the old days, many wives went nuts at their husbands for stinking out the house!
        </p>
        <p>
          When the grease is as liquid as possible,<br />
          leave the chain in the grease for around 10 to 15 minutes,<br />
          to allow the chain to get up to maximum heat, which will allow the grease to seep deep inside the chain.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then lift the chain out of the grease with the metal coat hanger (or whatever you used),<br />
          allow excess grease to drip off and fall back in to the grease tin.<br />
          Then put chain on top of the inside of the grease tin lid to cool down.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some enthusiasts may want more grease on their chain than the method above, especially in winter.<br />
          This requires turning the heat off and waiting for some time and then removing the chain from grease.<br />
          The longer you leave the heat turned off before removing the chain,<br />
          the more grease will be on the chain (you can get too much grease on it!).
        </p>
        <p>
          After a chain has been in grease and cooled down, it may be shorter than when it went in.<br />
          That's because it stretched while being used on the bike, the grease puts it back to a near new state.<br />
          So you may need to slacken the chain adjusters on the bike before you can put the chain back on<br />
          (slacken the back wheel of course and push wheel forwards,<br />
          which is part of basic chain adjustment which you should already know).
        </p>
        <p>
          A newly greased chain,<br />
          will not need any chain lube (chain oil, spray can etc.) put on it until the grease has worn off the outside of the chain.<br />
          Since the grease is really a wax, it is not sticky, so will not attract the dirt, grit and it's thick,<br />
          it could take a long time before chain lube is required.<br />
          Do not put chain lube on a chain that is well greased,<br />
          it may remove the grease (which is superior to chain lube) on the outside of the chain.<br />
          Some traditionalists will say, do not use chain lube, simply put the chain back in to the grease,<br />
          to make it even easier, have 2 chains, one on the bike,<br />
          the other greased and ready to put on when the other one needs to be re greased.
