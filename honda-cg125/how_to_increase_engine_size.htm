          Big Bore CG125 Engines
        </h2>
        <p>
          I first found out that it is possible to overbore and over stroke small Honda OHC engines from a website called Kaila.net/TL125.<br />
          From this website I found that it was possible to raise the cubic capacity of TL/CB125 engines<br />
          to 150cc by increasing the bore to 61mm and to go further by altering the crank to get about 210cc.<br />
          Since the cg125 engine is similar to the OHC engines<br />
          (But better because there is no cam chain and cam bearings to go wrong)<br />
          I obtained cg125 top end to overbore from a motorcycle scrapyard.

          All of the above pistons use a 15mm diameter pin
        </p>
        <p>
          As you can see from the above chart, the most sensible choice is the Honda cb550 or cbx550 route.<br />
          As the cg125 cast iron liner is only 71mm in outer diameter,<br />
          boring out to 61mm or even 63mm leaves little in the way of metal behind and would probably fail.<br />
          The solution is to machine out the cg125 liner and press in a Honda 550 or750 liner coated with araldite,<br />
          and then bore out to the correct bore for the piston.<br />
          According to Dave at PISTONBROKE (Dave does this sort of thing often)<br />
          the mouth of the cg/cb125 crankcase needs opening by about 1mm to accommodate<br />
          the lower part of a cb750 liner, also by doing so risks breaking into an oil way on cg125 engines.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Pistons
        </h2>
        <p>
          The Honda cg125 piston has a 15mm gudgeon pin and a slightly domed crown,<br />
          the CB550 also uses a 15mm gudgeon pin but the piston is flat toped and .5mm<br />
          smaller crown height meaning lower compression.<br />
          I have recently found out that Honda CBX550 pistons may have a domed crown<br />
          thus making it a better option by keeping the compression ratio at about 9.5/1.<br />
          Higher compression means more power, but good fuel is needed.<br />
          Lower compression means slightly less power but poorer quality fuel works fine.<br />
          I decided to bore out to 58.75mm (all I could obtain from David Silver spares was a CB550 .25mm oversized piston kit)
        </p>
        <h2>
          How it was done
        </h2>
        <p>
          Because I work in an engineering factory I had the barrel bored out on a Dean Smith &amp; Grace centre lathe.<br />
          A friend at work clamped the barrel in a four jaw lathe chuck,<br />
          adjusted the jaws until the bore was true using a dial gauge and bored it out to58.73mm.<br />
          Then using fine grade emory cloth, the tooling marks where polished out taking the bore size out to the desired 58.75mm.<br />
          The cylinder head was cleaned and the intake and exhaust passageways polished using a dremel type rotary tool.<br />
          The valves where reground in using grinding paste.<br />
          The barrel, piston and head was fitted on to the engine using standard gaskets.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Teething Problems
        </h2>
        <p>
          I started first time but ran rough until I sorted out the carb.<br />
          The carburettor needle has 3 grooves with the circlip fitted to the middle one;<br />
          I found that if I moved the circlip to the top groove the engine worked well.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Performance
        </h2>
        <p>
          I have found that there is a noticeable increase in power as the bike can climb hills better<br />
          and where as before it would only do 55mph on the flat (I am quite heavy)<br />
          I now can get 63mph.<br />
          A lighter rider may perhaps get 68-70mph but that would be quite scary on my 1978 cb100n with cg125 engine.<br />
          I consider the modifications to have been worthwhile because I can maintain a higher average speed when riding the bike.<br />
          In America, according to the tl125 website,<br />
          they bore out the crank pin holes then press in offset bushes to lengthen the stroke of the engine.<br />
          An aluminium thick washer is fitted between the barrel and crankcase mouth<br />
          so that with the extra stroke the piston does not kiss the valves.<br />
          I don’t think this mod would make a reliable engine because a bush could come adrift and cause mechanical mayhem.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Someone else emailed me and says
        </h2>
        <p>
          The second line states the cast iron barrel is 71mm OD when it's only 62.5mm OD measured from bottom of barrel.<br />
          The correct place to measure is at the bottom, not at the top.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a site where you can get CB550 pistons up to 1mm over size<br />
          <a href="http://www.cmsnl.com">www.cmsnl.com</a> page <a href=
          "http://www.cmsnl.com/products/piston-25-repro_06132374000p/">http://www.cmsnl.com/products/piston-25-repro_06132374000p/</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          This will then give you the choice of going up to 59.5mm, 3mm over size.<br />
          You can increase the compression by having the head ground or if you wish to keep your head standard, use the<br />
          head gasket off a W model (1998) onwards which all use a metal head gasket which is approx. 0.5mm thinner.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have 2 early cg engines 2 Brazil's, One W model, One M model, One ES4 engine.<br />
          All engines to M model (pre 2004) have 15mm gudgeon pin but the ES4 model (2004 on) has a 13mm gudgeon pin<br />
          The barrel (M and ES) (2001 onwards) has an oil way in the base, so you cannot use an early barrel on these later engines.<br />
          Also the cylinder head has a different shape combustion chamber<br />
          and will not fit on early models as the domed piston will hit the cylinder head.
        </p>

        <p>
          Please note any engine mods can shorten engine life / if done wrong will break your engine.<br />
          Also note all pre 2004 models with drum front brake can be a bit lacking on stopping power,<br />
          even with new shoes and properly set up if you are in the 19 stone bracket. It is like riding 2 up on the bike.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm in the lucky passion of having 3 cg125 and lots of spares.<br />
          To start with I will put an end to some of the myths 1976-80 approx. models did not run bigger valve heads.<br />
          They did have a carb with a lot bigger slide which helped with performance at the cost of fuel if ridden flat out all the time.<br />
          Fuel would drop to 75-80mpg.
        </p>
        <p>
          The problem of doing a general guide of how to do mods<br />
          and results is Honda over the years has changed air box intake size (more restrictive) and the jet sizes.<br />
          Slow running jet 36-40 Main jet 80-110, needle size and slide size.<br />
          Standard type carb, then carb with accelerator pump and back to standard carb for ES4 2004 model on.<br />
          The compression ratio also changes on years from 9:1-9.5:1.<br />
          The 1997-2003 W and M1 models had the most restrictive air box intake.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mods done to my 1999 cg125 W model.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cylinder head .010 ground off head, Head polished and ported,<br />
          1mm over size piston which gives you 128.5cc. Needle lifted up one notch on slide.<br />
          A little harder to kick over. I weigh in at 19 stone so a lighter rider of 12 stone would probably get higher speeds.<br />
          After running in the bore will do 70mph/75mph on flat<br />
          so if we allow 10% for speedo error would be more realistic 63mph-68mph.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reason for myself to improve performance was to get a bit more lower down power (torque)<br />
          as my 25 mile travel is 30-40mph limits with a couple of 50mph.<br />
          As a result of mods I can go down to 20mph in top gear on flat<br />
          and pull away up to 40mph at half throttle in approx. 8-10 seconds.<br />
          With added bonus of 135mpg+ winter riding, in summer 145mpg and the best ever of 155mpg.<br />
          The lowest was 115mpg giving it some right stick.<br />
          My carb has slow running jet 36 and main off 82.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember any modes to improve performance if ridden hard will shorten engine life and ruin your fuel economy.

        </p>
        <p>
          Please note the Chinese clone Honda CG125 overbore and big bore kits will not fit on genuine Honda CG125 engines.<br />
          I have emailed a few Honda CG owners who were disappointed when they bought their kits and did not fit.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reason the Chinese CG150cc kit does not fit is the liner is OD 67.5mm (too big)<br />
          and the Honda CG crank cases are only OD 64mm (to small).<br />
          So to be made to fit would take full engine strip and major machine work to crank case,<br />
          and the danger of breaking into one of the oil ways.<br />
          Remember this work will not be cheap and not all Honda Cg125 crank case will be able to be machined bigger.<br />
          Honda changed the design of crank case over the years.
