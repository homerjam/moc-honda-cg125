          Motorcycle Universal Screen Review
        </h1>
        <p>
          <strong>including Givi A601 A602 A603 A604 and A660 Universal Screens</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Motorbike Universal Screens, also known as Windshields and Airstars,<br />
          are an essential accessory to any motorcycle that does not have a screen.<br />
          The strength of wind and duration of riding is the main cause of fatigue on your body and head.<br />
          So unless you're in a city where you are protected by buildings and your speed is less than 50 mph, you need a screen.
        </p>
        <h2>
          A good screen will
        </h2>
        <p>
          Dramatically reduce wind fatigue on your body<br />
          Improve wind resistance so less engine power and fuel needed<br />
          (5 to 25% more speed against a strong head wind and at least 5% fuel saving in my tests)<br />
          Improve the bike's stability especially when overtaking traffic since your body will not be blown all over the place<br />
          (screen will even protect you a bit from side winds)<br />
          Protect you from most of the rain, insects and cold in winter<br />
          Reduce wind noise in your helmet (a bad screen will increase the noise.<br />
          If you wear motorcycle ear plugs noise is not a problem)
        </p>
        <h2>
          Universal Screen Mounting / Fitting kits (getting a good one is more important than the screen)
        </h2>
        <p>
          In order to fit a screen to a motorcycle you need a mounting kit (often supplied with screen). There are two types.
        </p>
        <p>
          Type one attaches to the headlight bracket and can only support a small screen.<br />
          The headlight must be of standard size (small bikes and custom bikes are too small).
        </p>
        <p>
          Type two attaches to the handlebars and can support a screen of medium to large size<br />
          (very large screens have an extra attachment to the front forks).<br />
          There are only 2 standard handlebar sizes and nearly every motorcycle in the world is one or the other.<br />
          Most universal handlebar mounting kits can adapt to both.<br />
          The quality and amount of positions a handlebar mounting kit can adapt to is crucial.<br />
          It will not only make it easier to install but also gives you more screen positions to try<br />
          (to get the wind flowing over you better with less noise).<br />
          Clutch and brake cables can also get in the way so you need to be able to go under or over them as needed.<br />
          Some handlebars have limited free space and in different places on the left and right,<br />
          so you need a mounting kit with as many positions as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          You often cannot tell the quality of a mounting kit<br />
          until you have tested it for a few hundred miles with some very strong gusty winds.<br />
          You at least need to see it in pieces to try and work out if it's strong enough.<br />
          The main purpose of this review is to test the mounting kits for quality and amount of positions they are capable of.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've tested 2 handlebar mounting kits.<br />
          One very good one by Givi for their screens and one very bad one by Airblade for their screen.<br />
          See How to fit a Givi Handlebar Screen and Why not to fit an Airblade Screen sections below.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Givi Screens
        </h2>
        <p>
          Givi is sold all around the world and can be purchased in most countries.
        </p>
        <p>
          The current Givi Screens that attach to the handlebars only are the A601, A602, A603, A604 and A660.<br />
          They all use the same Givi mounting / fitting kit.<br />
          Choosing the correct shape and size screen for you is important.<br />
          Below are links to pictures of each screen and dimensions, you can also look at the <a href="http://www.givi.co.uk/">Givi Website</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="images/givi_a601.jpg">A601</a> The screen is 36.9 cm high (from top of headlight part to tip of screen) and 42.5 cm wide.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="images/givi_a602.jpg">A602</a> The screen is 40 cm high (from top of headlight part to tip of screen) and 53 cm wide.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="images/givi_a603.jpg">A603</a> The screen is 37.7 cm high (from top of headlight part to tip of screen) and 44 cm wide.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="images/givi_a604.jpg">A604</a> The screen is 37.9 cm high (from top of headlight part to tip of screen) and 44.5 cm wide.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="images/givi_a660.jpg">A660</a> The screen is 42.5 cm high (from top of headlight part to tip of screen) and 42 cm wide.
        </p>
        <p>
          To work out the correct size and shape for you, sit on the motorcycle and put one foot on the footrest.<br />
          Try to get yourself in the normal riding position by putting the bike on the road and look at what's in your mirrors<br />
          (is the road behind you too high or low?).
        </p>
        <p>
          Get a ruler and measure the height from the top of the headlight to your nose.<br />
          The reason for this is if the wind gets under your chin, expect low frequency wind buffeting to get inside the helmet.<br />
          Most riders prefer just under eye height since it's far less noisy,<br />
          unless your helmet has a poor visor seal (high frequency problem).<br />
          Most riders hate having to look through a screen since vision is reduced.
        </p>
        <p>
          The width of the screen should ideally be as wide as your body with your coat on.
        </p>
        <p>
          The screen height and width are the most important, but the shape and curves are also important.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Givi A601 is designed for looks at the expense of noise and stability see <a href="givi_a601_review.htm">Givi A601 Review</a><br />
          The Givi A660 is a brilliant screen in every way see <a href="givi_a660_review.htm">Givi A660 Review</a><br />
          The Givi A602 A603 and A604 will be much more like the A660 than the A601.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you end up with very loud wind noise,<br />
          protect your ears or over time (months or years) you will permanently damage your hearing and suffer from tinnitus.
        </p>
        <p>
          A sign of exposure to very loud noise is reduced hearing for an hour or so afterwards.<br />
          If you're exposed to a very loud noise<br />
          it's critical that you do not let it continue for more than a few minutes per trip (never more than 1hr).<br />
          Motorcycle ear plugs(must be designed for motorcycle use) will totally protect your hearing with any screen and at any speed<br />
          (faster you go the louder the noise)<br />
          A small amount of people find ear plugs impossible or uncomfortable to use<br />
          (try different makes, shapes or get some custom made to fit your ears).<br />
          Some people have a wax problem in their ears<br />
          (try wax softening ear drops (or olive oil) and or go to your doctor and get your ears syringed).<br />
          Less effective ways to reduce noise include wearing a balaclava or scarf,<br />
          fitting a wind blocker (sits under a full face helmet and around your neck),<br />
          ear plugs that do not go inside the ear (from some chemists, there like chewing gum,<br />
          sticks to outside of your ear but only half the protection of in ear plugs).
        </p>

          How to fit a Givi Handlebar Screen
        </h2>
        <p>
          The Givi handlebar mounting / fitting kit is of high quality and is very adaptable to many different positions.<br />
          In fact it's so adaptable to so many different positions it's almost impossible to list all of them.<br />
          It's very easy to miss some of them even when there in your hands.
        </p>
        <p>
          Have a look at the pictures in the links below to see some of the different mounting positions.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="images/givi_a601.jpg">Position 1</a>
        </p>

          <a href="images/givi_a660.jpg">Position 2</a>

        </p>
        <p>
          The screen below is no longer available but it's the same Givi mounting kit (it's on a Honda CG125 2004 to 2008 model)
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
          The image above was cut out of the Givi fitting instructions page 2, study it while I try to explain as many positions as I can.
        </p>
        <p>
          Part 12 goes around the handlebars and Part 13 goes inside it to adapt it to small handlebars.<br />
          Part 12 has a cone shaped side with many groves in it like a cog which goes inside an inverted identical cone in Part 11 or 2.<br />
          This cog system means you can move the parts 360 degrees,<br />
          so Part 12 can be mounted vertically / horizontally or any position you can think of.
        </p>
        <p>
          Part 11 allows the metal rod (part 1) to go through it so the rod length can be adjusted.<br />
          The rod is round so the part can turn 360 degrees.<br />
          There are two Part 11 parts one for the left and one for the right.<br />
          Both parts are the opposite of each other, so one has the cog on the left and the other on the right.<br />
          The clever bit is that you can remove Part 11 from the rod and put either version on the left or right handlebar<br />
          (handy when you are trying to avoid clutch cable).<br />
          When you tighten the screw in Part 11 it also makes Part 11 grip the rod tight.
        </p>
        <p>
          Part 2 is identical to Part 11 in every way except it does not allow the metal rod (Part 1) to go all the way through it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Part 3 can turn 360 degrees inside Part 4.
        </p>
        <p>
          Part 4 has a little piece sticking out the bottom that connects to a small hole in the screen.<br />
          Along with the main hole in the screen this means the screen is firmly held and cannot rotate once screwed into position.
        </p>
        <p>
          Part 6 is a rubber gasket, one on the front and another on the back of the screen;<br />
          it distributes and cushions the stress of Part 4 and Part 5 on the screen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Part 5 goes on the outside of the screen; a screw goes through the middle and the screen in to Part 4.
        </p>
        <p>
          The maximum possible length,<br />
          from Part 11 to Part 2 (furthest ends of each part) with the metal rod (Part 1) at full length is 20 cm.<br />
          Part 12 is 2 cm wide where it goes around the handlebars.<br />
          Part 12 with Part 11 or Part 2 attached sticks out a total of 2 to 2.5 cm away from the handlebar.
        </p>
        <p>
          All the screws need a standard 5 mm Allen key (6 sided hex key) to tighten them.<br />
          Any cable ties that hold the electrical cables to the handlebars can often be removed and repositioned.<br />
          Look for a little plastic piece inside it and move it.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you have fitted the screen to the bike,<br />
          move the handlebars as far to the left and right as possible and make sure no cables are caught including the clutch.
        </p>
        <p>
          Find the best wind and noise position for the screen by finding a straight road with headwind,<br />
          speed the bike up to get a decent amount of headwind.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take your left hand off the handlebar and hold it horizontally, move it up the middle of your body until you feel the wind.<br />
          Put your hand back on the handlebar and then listen to the wind noise,<br />
          move your body down and up also forward and backward to find the best spot.<br />
          Then re-adjust the screen to the ideal position.

        <h2>
          Why not to fit an Airblade Screen
        </h2>
        <p>
          The Airblade handlebar mounting / fitting kit is supplied with their Custom Blade Screen<br />
          (screen looks identical to the Givi A601 but mounting kit is totally different).<br />
          Its design in my opinion is not capable of holding the screen up and is dangerous.<br />
          I found the parts to be very substandard resulting in screws shaking loose and threads being stripped.<br />
          I thought I had received a faulty one until I found two others on motorcycles with screws replaced.<br />
          I've not found any with all the original screws in<br />
          and even then I don't believe the threads will last very long since the metal is too soft and some screws are too small.<br />
          I will not bother to list the other faults with it. It probably breaks at least one law in your country for being too dangerous to
          use.<br />
          In my opinion and experience it could cause an accident. I knew the problem with it and so tightened it as much as possible.<br />
          After 100 miles the screen fell down on the right hand side<br />
          when a lorry travelling in the opposite direction hit me with a strong gust of wind. This was just before a tight bend.<br />
          The distraction of the screen falling down was bad enough but it also effected the steering since the left hand side did not drop.<br />
          This could never have happened so catastrophically with the Givi design.
