          3 Finger Winter Motorcycle Glove Review
        </h1>
        <p>
          This review is not about a particular brand or model of Winter Glove,<br />
          instead it will show you what a difference a 3 finger glove makes to motorcycling.
        </p>
        <p>
          The review below was written in 2009.<br />
		  All Hein Gericke stores in the UK were closed down or sold to their competitors in 2012 and 2013.<br />
		  The Hein Gericke brand (a German company) was purchased by a Chinese company in late 2013 or early 2014.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img alt="" height="325" src="images/pathanevo_3_finger.jpg" style="float: left" width="155" />
        </p>
        <p class="down-30px">
          The Hein Gerick Pathan Evo 3 Finger Glove is made for very cold weather.<br />
          A 3 finger design is superior to a 5 finger design<br />
          at reducing wind chill between the fingers.
        </p>
        <p>
          It also has<br />
          3M Thinsulate Thermal Insulation
        </p>
        <p>
          Sheltex (waterproof, windproof, breathable) membrane.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pittards Leather
        </p>
        <p>
          3M Scotchlite Reflective Material
        </p>
        <p>
          And Costs £42.99
        </p>
        <p class="under-img">
          The 3 finger design is much better at reducing the cold than 5 finger.<br />
          I have used these gloves on a 130 mile ride in cold weather (below 5c and no sun).
        </p>
        <p>
          The feel and control I had of the bike was very surprisingly good for a winter glove.<br />
          I was able to chuck the bike round tight twisty bends and use the throttle, brakes and clutch very well and precisely.<br />
          I had no problem filtering through rush hour traffic in grid lock etc.<br />
          I also had very good control and feeling from my thumb (very good for starting the bike, using the indicators etc.).<br />
          All this meant I could really enjoy riding the bike and push it very hard, much like in summer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite the 3 finger design, the gloves were not perfect at stopping the cold (I do not know any that are).<br />
          The ends of my fingers and thumb did get a little cold after around 20 miles, but not excessively cold.<br />
          The very surprising thing is, as the miles increased my fingers and thumb did not get any colder (very strange).<br />
          I assume this was due to the gloves keeping the rest of my hand warm (including my blood)<br />
          and the warm blood flowing to my fingers and thumb stopping them from getting any colder.
        </p>
        <p>
          I did find reducing my grip slightly on the handle bars reduced the cold in my fingers and thumbs substantially,<br />
          which supports this idea.
        </p>
        <p>
          The areas of my fingers and thumbs that got cold, could well be the parts that heated handle bar grips could reach.<br />
          Unfortunately my motorcycle does not have enough power to use heated handle bar grips (it's only a 125cc bike).<br />
          But if I had a bike that could I would try them with these gloves.
        </p>
        <p>
          The other surprising thing with these gloves is they are not too hot to use in warmer weather,<br />
          so as the day warms up you can still use them.<br />
          I tried them on another ride when it was over 15c and the sun was shining and had no problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          If I am trying to keep my fingers warm,<br />
          I will never use a 5 finger glove again, there is just no way it could compete with a 3 finger.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course a 2 finger design would be even warmer,<br />
          but some people with powerful braking systems like to brake with only 2 fingers and use the other 2 to steady the handlebars.
        </p>
        <p>
          Only downsides I have found.<br />
          No visor wipe or cloth when it's raining (UK winters have a lot of rain), but the thumb is soft leather that may do something.<br />
          Glove is very, very good quality and value,<br />
          but I would have preferred if they also made a higher quality 3 finger glove at around the £80 mark.

        <h2>
          Update
        </h2>
        <p>
          On a 65 mile ride at -1c to -3c,<br />
          headwind and no sun the gloves let the ends of my fingers and thumb get uncomfortably cold after 35 miles.<br />
          I managed to complete the 65 miles non-stop but I was trying every trick in the book to keep them warm.<br />
          I expect under gloves would have improved the situation but not solved it, the cold + wind chill and distance were just too great.<br />
          Heated handlebar grips and may be even handlebar muffs were well and truly going through my mind during that ride.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have a 125cc bike or lower there may be some handlebar grips that use low enough power to work,<br />
          especially if you can switch your headlight off.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can easily obtain Handlebar muffs at most motorcycle shops and loads of people report they really work well.<br />
          But some people have reported that cheap badly designed ones<br />
          can let the wind push them against the brake lever slightly resulting in a warped brake disc.
