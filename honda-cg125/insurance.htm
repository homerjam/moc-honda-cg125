        <h1>
          Motorcycle Insurance in the UK
        </h1>
        <p>
          In the UK, there is one golden rule with insurance that applies to any make or model of motorcycle,<br />
          shop around and get as many quotes as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every year when your insurance comes up for renewal,<br />
          shop around again and get as many quotes as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          I cannot tell you which insurance broker is the cheapest or most expensive for you,<br />
          it depends on so many variables including your age, bike and location.<br />
          Don't be surprised if you see variations of 50% or even over 100% in the cheapest and most expensive price.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some insurance companies change their risk assessment system every few months<br />
          which can also lead to a dramatic change in price.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a list of insurance brokers simply google motorcycle insurance
        </p>
        <p>
          Nearly all insurance brokers sell several different insurance policies from different insurance companies.<br />
          Brokers often charge you an administration fee (the price is included in the insurance quote).<br />
          This fee sometimes varies by more than Â£10 for an identical insurance policy from the same insurance company.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would advise against relying on websites that claim to compare loads of different insurance brokers for you.<br />
          Because all the ones I have found are missing at least one that is often the cheapest.<br />
          I am not the only one to warn about these sorts of websites,<br />
          they have been reported in the press several times for car insurance and other types of insurance.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want or need breakdown cover,<br />
          when you get an insurance quote,<br />
          it is worth looking if it comes with free breakdown cover or if it is an optional extra.<br />
          Since it often works out cheaper than buying breakdown cover separately.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you need to find out how much your bike is worth,<br />
          please see my <a href="links.htm#Used-Bike-Prices-UK">Used Bike Prices UK</a> and the 2nd Hand Bike Ads UK section beneath it.
