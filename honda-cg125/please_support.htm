Please Support this Website </b></span></p>
<p>Please support this website, it will not cost you anything, no money 
at all, it should save you money!<br>
That's because I can raise money on commission for referring you to cheap motorcycle insurance 
for any make or model of motorcycle.</p>
<p>I am currently funding this website out of my own pocket.<br>
I am not well off, my 125cc motorcycle is my only form of transport (except for 
my bicycle).<br>
I have already had to cut off my 
internet connection at home to save money, that's why I can't read emails daily 
anymore.<br>
All I ideally want is to raise enough insurance commission to make this website 
support itself (so I do not need to continue putting money in to it).</p>
<p>I created the <a href="insurance.htm">Insurance</a> webpage to help people save money on any make or model of motorcycle.<br>
If you click on the insurance pictures / icons (in Insurance 
webpage) it sends you to their website and 
tells them you were referred by this website,<br>
I then get a small commission on every policy sold.<br>
Almost nobody viewing this website has ever taken out a policy, hardly 
anyone has even had a quote!</p>
<p>All I ask is if your in the UK, every time your insurance comes up for 
renewal or you get another make or model of bike, please try my
Insurance webpage.<br>
If it costs the same as any insurance you find elsewhere or saves you money, 
please support this website.</p>
<p>In the unlikely event you find an insurance company / broker that is cheaper 
than the ones in my Insurance webpage, please use 
the one you find,<br>
I do not want people to pay any money to help this website (I set it up to save 
people money).</p>
<p>In the last 12 months only 3 people took out insurance (from both of my websites 
combined, Honda CG125 and 125cc Bike Club),<br>
it appears nearly everyone forgets about my <a href="insurance.htm">Insurance</a> 
webpage when its time to take out insurance (that explains why hardly 
anyone even gets a quote).</p>
<p>I am still updating this website regularly (when I get a chance to borrow an 
internet connection),<br>
so if you save or print this website it may be out of date within weeks (so I 
always recommend you view this website on the internet).</p>
<p>My time and money is still being put in to my motorcycle to try and test 
things for the website (the list is endless and the miles high),<br>
as well as learning things to add / change on the website (you never stop 
learning / finding things no matter how skilled / experienced you get).</p>
