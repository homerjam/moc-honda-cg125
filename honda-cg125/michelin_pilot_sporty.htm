          Michelin Pilot Sporty Motorcycle Tyre Review
        </h1>
        <p>
          As of March 2014 there are a few Michelin Pilot Sporty tyres available in a few shops.<br />
          But I expect when they run out of stock, there will be no more.
        </p>
        <p>
          At last a tyre using modern materials and design with performance to match<br />
          is available for the most common 125cc motorbikes as well as many 50 to 250cc.<br />
          No matter if you're a learner, commuter, advanced, sports, city or countryside rider<br />
          the Michelin Pilot Sporty tyre is my most highly recommended tyre for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most important thing you learn with motorcycling over time<br />
          is how the quality of the tyres can transform or ruin your riding experience and safety.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tyre quality not only affects how well the bike handles, brakes, swerves, feels and comfort.<br />
          But can also cause an accident or help prevent one.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Michelin Pilot Sporty tyres are available in loads of different sizes to fit many 125cc<br />
          and other motorcycles 
		  <a href="http://moto.michelin.co.uk/tyres/michelin-pilot-sporty">Michelin Pilot Sporty website</a>.<br />
          They are tubeless tyres that are designed to be used with a tube (inner tube) if fitted to a tube type wheel.<br />
          All wheels that have spokes are tube type wheels; even if a wheel does not have spokes it may or may not be tubeless design.
        </p>
        <p>
          I put a pair of 2.75 - 18 Front, 90 / 90 - 18 Rear on a Honda CG125 (front disc brake model).
        </p>
        <p>
          I have covered around 50,000 miles with tyres around those sizes on several different bikes<br />
          between 100 and 250cc, over many years (I passed my motorcycle test a long time ago).
        </p>
        <p>
          So I have experience in how such narrow tyres should perform<br />
          (narrow tyres are normally found on most 50 to 250cc bikes).
        </p>
        <p>
          The Michelin Pilot Sporty tyres have been used<br />
          in every weather condition and roads in the UK all year round.<br />
          Except in snow or ice (I draw the line with riding any motorcycle in those conditions).
        </p>
        <p>
          They have been on small roads, large roads, motorways, steep roads, very strong gusty side winds,<br />
          near freezing conditions, over 30c weather and rain.<br />
          As well as very tight bends, long distances (250 miles in a day), city traffic jams at rush hour,<br />
          pot holes and roads whose surface is disintegrating.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tyres have performed incredibly well and I cannot fault them in any way (which is even more incredible).<br />
          They are so far ahead of other tyres I have used in the past (similar sized tyres).<br />
          Read my <a href="pirelli_city_demon.htm">Pirelli City Demon Tyre Review</a> to see what happens when you use a bad quality tyre.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Cornering (going round bends)
        </h2>
        <p>
          These tyres grip so well I cannot get them to slip or wobble no matter how hard I go in to a bend.<br />
          I would say the cornering abilities are sports level,<br />
          but my bike does not have the ground clearance and I do not have the training to try and get my knee on the ground.<br />
          The tyres are so well behaved, predictable, forgiving, it does not matter if you're a learner or an advanced motorcyclist,<br />
          they will go round the bend easily.<br />
          The tyres also easily let you change your line in the bend and even in the middle<br />
          (I cannot say the same for other tyres I have used in the past).
        </p>
        <h2>
          Stability
        </h2>
        <p>
          The tyres are very stable including in a straight line<br />
          (the tyres are not twitchy or diving in to corners to quickly or severely unless you want them to).
        </p>
        <h2>
          Braking
        </h2>
        <p>
          The grip, stability and feel from the tyres really improve the braking power<br />
          and control including under very heavy and emergency braking.<br />
          Not only can you stop in less distance, but can do it without the tyres wobbling / squirming or complaining.<br />
          You can swerve at the same time with ease unlike many other tyres<br />
          (very handy in an emergency or just rushing to the red traffic lights).
        </p>
        <h2>
          Swerving
        </h2>
        <p>
          These tyres can swerve around things very quickly and easily.<br />
          So well it could easily prevent certain accidents.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Side winds
        </h2>
        <p>
          Due to the high level of grip and the profile of the tyre (you only need to lean slightly to get tyres to lean in to the wind);<br />
          side winds have far less impact on the bike and rider than other tyres I have used in the past.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Comfort and Feel
        </h2>
        <p>
          These tyres give lots of feel of the road surface and yet are also very comfortable.<br />
          It might seem impossible to have both at the same time, but these tyres are advanced modern tyres and manage it brilliantly.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Wet weather
        </h2>
        <p>
          They still grip well (you always loose some grip in the wet with any tyre); despite having a semi slick design,<br />
          the Silica in the tyre probably helps.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Wear rate
        </h2>
        <p>
          The wear rate is good, that's almost unbelievable due to the high performance of the tyre,<br />
          the Silica in the tyre is probably responsible.<br />
          On a Honda CG125 Front Disc brake model,<br />
          I managed to wear the rear tyre out after around 8000 miles (mileage will vary depending on riding style and weight).<br />
          But the front is hardly worn at that mileage (so should last at least twice the mileage).
        </p>
        <h2>
          Rolling Resistance
        </h2>
        <p>
          These tyres have very good low rolling resistance.<br />
          You first notice it when you try to push the bike around by hand.<br />
          But you also notice it when the engine is moving the bike<br />
          and especially when going up hills or when you have a lot of weight on the bike.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Conclusion
        </h2>
        <p>
          The reason I believe the Michelin Pilot Sporty tyre performs so well is the design and materials Michelin have put in to it.<br />
          Tyre technology on the race track has improved substantially over the years<br />
          and has been filtering down to larger engine road motorcycles (wider tyres).<br />
          Michelin has modified the race tyre to make a road going version.<br />
          A review of the Michelin Pilot Sport Tyre<br />
          (the Michelin Pilot Sporty has evolved from) <a href=
          "http://www.motorcycle.com/products/michelin-pilot-sport-3530.html">http://www.motorcycle.com/products/michelin-pilot-sport-3530.html</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          The Michelin Pilot Sporty tyres "tread design derived from the Pilot Sport tyre for superbikes"<br />
          Like the Sport tyre the Sporty has Silica in it which improves many aspects of the tyre.<br />
          All of this and more makes for a very advanced and modern tyre that performs in every way miles ahead of older materials,<br />
          construction and design.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to Michelin the Pilot Sporty tyres :<br />
          "Rubber compound - a versatile rubber compound is used, incorporating silica,<br />
          which results in excellent performance on dry roads,<br />
          whilst also ensuring good traction in the wet; without compromising on the mileage achieved.<br />
          Construction - the tyres are of bias construction, with two plies, which help both resistance and increase rider comfort.<br />
          The tyre also incorporates a reinforced bead base to improve handling and safety and also ensures the tyres are easier to fit."
        </p>
        <p>
          I very highly recommend the Michelin Pilot Sporty tyres for every type of rider.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're a learner they will make it easier to learn and require less skill to ride the bike.<br />
          They will also be more forgiving when you make mistakes, make you safer and may prevent some types of accidents.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're an advanced rider you will be able to get far more out of the tyres.<br />
          You will probably be amazed at how well a small bike can handle and grip compared to a larger bike<br />
          (since larger bikes often have high quality tyres on).<br />
          In the past small bikes often had outdated and primitive tyres<br />
          compared to the large bikes and especially the large sports road bikes.

        <h2>
          Update
        </h2>
        <p>
          Since publishing the review above 8 months ago,<br />
          I have had feedback from other people and done some extreme testing of the tyres.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have met an ex motorcycle riding instructor who has decades of experience with 125cc bikes and tyres.<br />
          He uses a Honda CG125 with a Front Disc brake to get around his large city.<br />
          After my advice he has tried the Michelin Pilot Sporty tyres,<br />
          he has pushed the tyres far harder than I could due to his abilities and training.
        </p>
        <p>
          He corners around the city at extreme lean angles<br />
          (all of the tyre tread is used and worn; do not try this without advanced training on any tyre).<br />
          Travelled in torrential rain downpours,<br />
          so the road is 100% covered in water (so aqua planning / skidding off is a problem for bikes and cars).<br />
          Carried a passenger, combined weight was over 25 stone (he is not light himself, somewhere between 16 and 18 stone).<br />
          And many very steep hills (some on 70mph roads) and badly maintained road surfaces.
        </p>
        <p>
          He reports the Michelin Pilot Sporty tyres are the best he has ever used on small bikes, in fact a lot better.<br />
          Due to his skill and training,<br />
          he pushes tyres far harder and beyond their abilities than normal riders (he corrects the slides and wobbling).<br />
          But for the first time, he has a tyre that he cannot find the limit of its abilities.<br />
          He also found the wet performance to be much better than any he has used before,<br />
          he finally got the front to slip slightly<br />
          when riding through standing water in the pouring rain while cornering way too hard on a smooth drain cover.<br />
          Like me he highly recommends the Michelin Pilot Sporty<br />
          as the best tyre for any type of rider including learners and advanced riders.
        </p>
        <p>
          Learners of different abilities are all going mad about how brilliant<br />
          the Michelin Pilot Sporty is compared to the tyres they had before.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have been hearing the same thing from motorcycle dealers, where customers have told them how good they are,<br />
          and it does not seem to matter what make or model of bike they are on,<br />
          all the customers are going mad about how good they are.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have been extreme brake testing the tyres;<br />
          this required massively increasing the brakes to put more pressure on the tyres.<br />
          I still failed to find the limit of the tyres,<br />
          even the ex-motorcycle riding instructor failed with the same braking power and a passenger down a very steep hill<br />
          (over 25 stone combined).<br />
          I tried 60mph on a straight level road in perfect condition with no other traffic around<br />
          and slammed on the brakes as hard as I dare.<br />
          I could not believe how quickly and in such a short distance the bike came to a complete stop,<br />
          it was 3 times less than I was expecting and 2 times less than I could have imagined,<br />
          in the end it was me chickening out since I did not want the rear wheel lifting off the ground or me going over the handlebars.<br />
          Learners please note,<br />
          do not try this type of breaking (emergency stop) on any bike or tyre without advice from a motorcycle riding instructor.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have also briefly tried a bike with a 250cc engine and still could not find the limit of the tyres.
        </p>
        <p>
          So my message to everyone is I and others very highly recommend you put the Michelin Pilot Sporty tyres on your bike.<br />
          Even if your existing tyres are hardly worn or even brand new,<br />
          if you could try the Michelin Pilot Sporty tyres,<br />
          I bet you would throw your existing tyres away and forget how much they are worth.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're a learner, ask your motorcycle riding instructor if they have a bike with Michelin Pilot Sporty on.<br />
          If they have not, ask why not, if they have never tried the Michelin Pilot Sporty they owe it to their customers to try it.<br />
          Tell them to read this review to see why they should try them and also let their customers try their bike.
