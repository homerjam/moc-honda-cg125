<p class="MsoNormal"><b><a name="Warranty"></a>Warranty</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the UK, the shop probably told you, that if a Honda dealer does not 
service the bike, the Honda 2 year warrantee is invalid,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">this is a deliberate lie to increase their profits, since 
there servicing costs are very expensive for hardly any work.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If you read the UK warranty book that comes with the bike, it 
states anyone can service the bike and the warranty stays intact, </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">the only way to invalidate the warranty is if you do not 
do the servicing correctly. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">For instance if you forget to change the oil at the correct 
mileage and the bike then develops a fault that is due to the lack of oil 
change, </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">you can not claim on the warranty to fix that fault. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">But if you have not changed the oil and the petrol tank 
rusts through (very unlikely), you can make a warranty claim for a tank. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I have confirmed all this with the Honda UK helpline who 
were emphatic about this. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I also remember the UK government passed a law about this a 
few years ago, </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">to stop all motor vehicles begin forced to be serviced at 
the manufacturers dealers, in order to keep the warranty. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Of course a dealer has no legal obligation to carry out 
warranty work unless you bought it from them.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>
<a name="How to find your bikes Tool Kit and Owners Manual"></a>How to find your 
bikes Tool Kit and Owners Manual</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">All motorbikes when new come with an Owner's Manual and a 
basic tool kit for the bike.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">These are normally stored in special compartments in the 
bike.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Its not uncommon for the owner to remove and store the 
Owner's Manual away from the bike, and do not return it when they sell the bike.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I would hope they do not do the same with the tool kit, it 
should always be left in the bike when travelling in case of breakdown.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Trying to find these special compartments can be tricky 
since they are small and often change from model to model of Honda CG125.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The tool kit for example is around 14 cm long, 7 cm wide, 3 
cm high on the Front Disc Brake model.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It has the very basics of tools needed for the bike, like 
the rear suspension adjustment spanner, spark plug tool and several other 
spanners and screwdrivers.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">On the Front Disc brake model, the special compartment is 
behind the left hand side panel, beneath the battery.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">But on other models it could be under the seat or even in 
the tail of the bike or just strapped to the battery.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Theirs a small chance it could be behind the right hand 
side panel, but all the space is normally taken up by the air filter.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">How to remove the seat depends on the model.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It’s usually held on by 2 screws or 2 nuts and bolts at only one 
end of the seat (one on each side). </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">They are usually underneath the back of the seat, but some 
models are at the front (need to remove both side panels to get to them).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Theirs even a possibility that instead of screws or bolts, 
it has 2 latches at the back, pull them towards the back of the bike to release,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">their could be a wire from the seat locked to the helmet 
lock to stop people stealing the seat.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The other end of the seat is normally held in place by a 
piece of the seat slotting in to a hole.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If theirs a storage compartment in the tail of the bike, 
you will need to remove the seat and unbolt and remove the grab rail,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">unbolt the tail from the bike and remove.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Owner's Manual is stored in a special compartment 
beneath the right hand side panel on the Front Disc brake model,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">but could also be in the same places as the tool kit 
mentioned above in other models.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><a name="Manuals"></a>Manuals</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">My website has been designed so you do not need any 
manuals, but if you have any of the following, I would use them as well as my 
website.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You can buy the Haynes Honda CG125 Owners Workshop Manual, 
this can probably replace the Honda CG125 Owner's Manual.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It also tells you how to service and repair the bike.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You can buy it in printed form or download it direct from the manufacturer.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Make sure it supports your model year, you will also find 
that it tells you everything for the oldest model it supports,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">then in the back of the book it tells you the changes in 
the instructions for newer models.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You can also buy the official Honda CG125 Workshop Manual 
for your model of Honda CG125.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You can probably get it from your local Honda dealer,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">but this manual is designed for experienced mechanics, so 
it probably will not tell you how to do very universal basic things.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><a name="Battery"></a>Battery</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Its behind the left hand side panel, if not it must be 
behind the right hand side panel (very unlikely).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The original battery in the front disc brake model is 
maintenance free, so do not touch it. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If you have a maintenance type battery, you need to keep an 
eye on the liquid levels of all 6 compartments, </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">keep the liquid between the min and max mark. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You top the battery up with distilled water which is 
available from most shops, </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">you can save money by buying the stuff for domestic steam 
irons from your supermarket, its the same stuff and says distilled water. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><a name="Oil change"></a>Oil change</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If you have the Owner's Manual, use it as a reference to the 
following, it's not essential to have it.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Owner's Manual states change every 2500 miles (1850 miles front drum 
brake model), </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I would change it at 2000 miles (1500 miles front drum 
brake model) for a mixture of short and 
long journeys,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">if you are mainly doing short journeys, change it every 1000 
to 1500 miles (1000 miles front drum brake model). </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There 
should never be a need for less than every 1000 miles.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The best advice is to treat the  mileage in the Owner's 
Manual as an absolute 
maximum. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Short journeys are bad for oil, the engine does not get up 
to heat and condensation occurs, </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">this means the oil will become dirtier per mile, than on 
normal journeys, so you need to change the oil at less mileage.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Its probably a good idea to change the oil every year, even 
if you have not done enough miles.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Tools Required.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">24mm Spanner or Socket to undo oil drain nut (left hand 
side of bike near the bottom), front drum brake model may need another size.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Front Drum Brake model may (depends on version) have another oil drain nut under the bike, 
needs another size of spanner, do not no what size.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Container to collect old oil (2 litre ice cream container 
or anything).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Rubber gloves to protect hands from oil.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Small funnel to help pour new oil in to bike (washing up 
liquid bottle, water bottle, pop or squash bottle cut in half and 100% cleaned 
and dry).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Warm up engine for at least 3 minutes (idling and revving, 
if you take bike for a long fast ride you will get more oil out but don't burn 
your fingers on the nut)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Switch off engine and immediately </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Put container under the bike to catch the oil</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Put rubber gloves on hands</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Remove the dip 
stick (black plastic knob, right hand side of bike, it measures the oil in the 
engine).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Remove the drain nut (see below, if the gear change lever 
is in the way see <a href="General.htm#Gear change lever">Gear change lever</a> in <a href="General.htm">General</a> page).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Front Drum Brake model may (depends on version) have 
a drain nut underneath the bike, </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">this should be used to drain the oil (not the oil filter / 
drain nut).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The drain nut (24mm, left hand side of bike near the 
bottom) has a large spring &amp; oil filter (metal gorse like a thimble that 
protects a sewing operators finger,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">use the spring to wiggle the filter out) sitting in it, 
clean filter with a suitable liquid like petrol (don't leave in petrol to long 
or it will eat the rubber)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If you clean the filter with petrol, the petrol will 
evaporate very quickly in the open air.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The front disc brake model claims you only need to clean 
the oil filter every 7500 miles, </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I would clean it more often, to stop the centrifugal oil filter having to clean the oil. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If you find anything major in the filter, look and think, 
if your worried show it to a mechanic, </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">its normal to get a bit of metal in their when an engine is 
running in.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Owner's Manual for the front disc brake model claims the centrifugal filter should be cleaned every 
7500 miles.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The centrifugal oil filter is inside the engine and never 
needs to be cleaned if you keep the other oil filter clean and change the oil on 
time or before,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">according to the mechanics. For more details see
<a href="#Centrifugal Oil filter">Centrifugal Oil filter</a> below.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The oil will continue to drip out the bike for ages, 
rocking the bike on the centre stand might help get more oil out.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When its stopped dripping, or you can not wait any longer, 
put the filter and drain nut back on.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Pour 900ml (1 litre bottles often have marks down the side) of 10W/40 new oil 
(see <a href="#Which Oil quality to use">Which Oil quality to use</a> below) in (put oil drain nut back in first),</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Check the oil level is at the max mark or above (see
<a href="#How to check the Oil level">How to check the Oil level</a> below),</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">warm engine up (screw dip stick back in first) for 3 minutes 
(idling and revving slightly in neutral) and check 
oil level after its been off for 5 minutes. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><a name="How to check the Oil level"></a>How to check 
the Oil level</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Remove dip stick (black plastic knob, right hand side of 
bike, it measures the oil in the engine), wipe the oil off,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">put dip stick back in bike but do not screw it in, the xxxx 
marks at the bottom of the dip stick should face sideways (not up and down),</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">take dip stick out of bike and look were the oil has gone 
up to on the dip stick, </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">the xxxx marks on the bottom of the dip stick mark the min 
and max mark.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Its much easier to see the oil in natural daylight than 
with a light bulb.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There's no harm going slightly above the max mark, but not 
excessively, never run the engine below the min mark.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Make sure you check the oil level with the bike on level 
ground.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><a name="Which Oil quality to use"></a>Which Oil quality 
to use</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Since the free 600 miles service I have used real semi 
synthetic oil.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Since I was running in the bike, I do not know what it did 
to the performance, but the clutch felt a lot smoother.  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There is an argument that I should have waited for the 
engine to run in before using semi synthetic oil.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Real semi synthetic oil will protect the engine when cold 
and also at high revs, it also will not break down as fast at high engine revs, </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">so the oil will do more miles before needing to be replaced (I would still change it 
early anyway), unlike mineral oil / fake semi synthetic oil.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Many oils claim to be semi 
synthetic but are in fact normal mineral oil. Silkolene Comp 4 is semi synthetic 
for sure.  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Best way to find out is to look at a manufactures whole range and buy the 
one just below the fully synthetic in price. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I would only use motorcycle oil, car oil might work but 
might cause trouble in the long term.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There are so many technical reasons why not to use car oil, 
even the highest quality car oil, just do not risk it.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I would not use a very cheap or unknown brand of motorcycle 
oil, since it could clog up the centrifugal oil filter and or even damage the 
engine.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It's ok to upgrade from mineral oil to real semi synthetic, 
but a bad idea to go back again, the engine could develop a fault.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Everyone except the oil companies advise against using 
fully synthetic oil, since its to good and a waste of money and could cause 
clutch slip, </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">clutch slip has however been said to be a bad rumour, but 
the idea has stuck in peoples brains. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Honda sell their own oil for all Honda bikes. They only 
sell mineral and semi synthetic. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Their must be a reason why they do not sell fully 
synthetic, so I have not used it.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If you want an explanation about oil and what is and 
what is not synthetic and why you would want real semi synthetic, </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I will need to be more precise.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Mineral oil comes out the ground.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Synthetic is supposed to be 100% man made.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One company messed around with mineral oil and claimed that 
since a person messed about with it, it was now semi synthetic, </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">their was a legal case and they won. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Based on that principle you could milk a cow and boil the 
milk 
and claim its now semi synthetic.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">All they did to the mineral oil was molecularly convert 
it.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There are two 100% man made products and they are real 
synthetics, since they are nothing to do with mineral oil.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One is Ester, this is what protects your engine when cold 
and also at high revs.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The other synthetic product is PAO</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ester clings to the parts in the engine and lubricates 
them,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Mineral oil does not cling as well when the engine is cold, 
this results in a lack of oil lubricating the engine, </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">which is why most engine wear happens when the engine is 
cold.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Mineral oil also loses its viscosity (thickness) at high temperatures, 
so when you are at high engine revs, the oil thins and loses its lubrication 
abilities,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">mineral oil also breaks down at high temperatures so must 
be replaced more often.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ester must be mixed with PAO or Mineral oil, else your 
engine would smash itself to pieces.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If you see on a oil label, fully synthetic, it will have no 
mineral oil in it. It will have a mixture of PAO and Ester or just PAO.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ester costs more than PAO, so PAO only oil will be much 
cheaper and useless. I have not seen any PAO only oil for motorcycles. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Their are often two grades of fully synthetic motorcycle 
oil, both have PAO and Ester, the quality and mixture is better in the more 
expensive version. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><a name="Centrifugal Oil filter"></a>Centrifugal Oil 
filter</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The centrifugal oil filter should not need to be touched as 
long as the oil has been changed at the correct mileage or before (see
<a href="#Oil change">Oil change</a> above).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">But some people change the oil every 5000 miles or never, 
this means the oil becomes very dirty, the filters then become clogged up and 
need to be cleaned.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When the oil becomes very dirty you will notice the colour 
change and other things,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">if you change the oil at the correct mileage or before (see
<a href="#Oil change">Oil change</a> above), the oil you drain out should be 
similar or identical to the new oil.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Different brands and models of oil can have different 
colours.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Most if not all mechanics never clean the Centrifugal Oil 
filter, including the Honda ones, unless it has clogged up due to lack of oil 
changes.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Owner's Manual for the front disc brake model claims the 
Centrifugal Oil filter should be cleaned every 
7500 miles, but the advice is to ignore it.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If the Centrifugal Oil filter has clogged up due to lack of 
oil changes, you will have to clean it or pay a mechanic.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Unless you are good mechanically or have a Haynes or other 
Honda CG125 workshop manual, do not try it yourself.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You need a special tool to remove it, the specifications of 
the tool can be obtained and manufactured at most motorcycle servicing shops.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The tool required may depend on the model of Honda CG125.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Haynes Workshop manual for the Honda CG125 should tell 
you and may even tell you how to make the tool yourself.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You also have to remove the oil, clutch cable, exhaust,

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><a name="Which Spark Plug Model"></a>Which Spark Plug 
Model</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When purchasing a new spark plug, there are 2 different 
models of spark plug for 2 different designs of Honda CG125 engine.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Lots of people and some mechanics can easily make a mistake 
since it’s often very hard to work out which one you need.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If you have the Owner’s Manual, it should tell you.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If you have the original spark plug put in the bike when 
manufactured you will no the correct spark plug model.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">But shop / mechanics often use spark plug manufacturers 
recommendations for Honda CG125 and they are often wrong or misread.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Haynes Workshop manual is also often used and misread 
(very easy to do).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt">The two different spark plug 
models are</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black">NGK DR8ES-L</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt">NGK DPR8EA-9</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">NGK is the name of the manufacture and the rest is their 
part number.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Different spark plug manufacturers make equivalent spark 
plugs but have different part numbers.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The spark plug manufacturers do have conversion charts so 
you can convert from one make to another.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">NGK is regarded by most people as the best and Honda 
currently fit them as standard to the Honda CG125.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As a guide, the older the bike, the more likely it will use 
the first spark plug model above.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The newer the bike, the more likely it will use the second 
spark plug model above.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If you can find your Honda CG125 model number and give it 
to a Honda dealer, they should be able to work out which spark plug you need.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">But don't let them simply go by the year the bike was 
built, only the model number will give the correct plug.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">That's because Honda CG125 are built in several different 
country's, one country could make new models and another could always stay 
making old models.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Spark Plugs based on year in the UK for example will assume 
you have a model imported by Honda UK,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">but loads of Honda CG125 in the UK are not imported by Honda UK and 
are often old model designs (often a 4 speed gearbox and old 
fashioned bodywork).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You might be able to find your model number on the chassis 
near or behind the left hand side panel, otherwise you need to find the frame 
number,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">the Haynes Workshop manual or a Honda dealer may be able to 
convert the frame number in to a model number.</p>

Spark Plug Information</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If you need a NGK DR8ES-L spark plug (see 
<a href="#Which Spark Plug Model">Which Spark Plug Model</a> above to find out), you need to set the 
gap (search the internet) to 0.7mm yourself.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">All of the information below only applies if your engine 
uses the <span style="font-size:11.0pt">NGK DPR8EA-9</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The book tells you to clean and check the gap of the plug 
every 2500 miles and replace every 5000.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You do not need to check the gap of a new 
spark plug,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">since its preset at the plug factory to the correct gap 
(NGK brand is for sure and is set to 0.9mm). </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I could not be bothered to clean and check the plug gap at 
2500 miles since a new plug only costs £2.99 to £5 dependant on shop. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">That means at 2500 miles the plug is only worth £1.50 to 
£2.50 so not worth the work of cleaning and checking the gap, so I put a new one 
in.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You need a&nbsp; NGK DPR8EA-9 spark plug for normal riding and a NGK 
DPR9EA-9 for extended high speed riding,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The extended high speed riding spark plug is stated in the 
Honda CG125 Front Disc brake models Owner's Manual,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">but can not be totally sure for other models, but it makes 
sense since its the same spark plug but gets rid of more heat out of the engine.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The following spark plug information is for the front disc 
brake model, </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I can not be sure if the same would apply to other models.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I found  that 54mph in 5th 
gear is 
high speed for the plug and results in power dropping off if left at that speed 
for 1/2 mile. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The power drop off (plug overheating), results in the bike 
dropping to 50mph against a strong head wind, if you slow down allot the plug will 
recover. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I fitted the DPR9EA-9 plug and end of problem = no power 
drop off and the bikes about 5 mph faster. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If you use the DPR9EA-9 for slow speed (especially idling a lot in traffic jams),</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">there's a chance the plug will not be hot enough to burn off 
petrol burning deposits on the electrode and the bike will stutter or stall. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I have not had any problems, but would not use it if I was 
in city traffic all the time with massive amounts of idling, </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">of course as soon as you get some speed going the plug will 
heat up and burn off the deposits. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The petrol quality could also effect this, I use Shell V 
Power since it has extra cleaners in it.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You can also buy a NGK Iridium spark plug, I got the one 
that’s equivalent to the DPR9EA-9, </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">its made a very slight improvement in smoothness, power, pulling power 
and less vibration. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">But its very slight and probably not work the price tag of 
3 times the price of a normal plug. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">But it will last 2 to 3 times as long. Iridium must not be 
cleaned or the gap changed. I suggest doing 10,000 miles with one.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Iridium plug also claims to burn off deposits more than 
a normal plug at slow speeds, so could help the high speed plug potential 
problem.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It also claims to require less power from the battery and 
ignites the petrol better on cold days.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Even O ring and fully enclosed chains need oiling.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Use a motorcycle chain oil, their are arguments for and 
against motorcycle chain wax so oil is recommended.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Engine or gear oil is not recommended (will just fling off 
very quickly).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You will no when to oil the chain by looking at it, and or 
kick the back wheel round and notice the chain going round, if it feels notchy, 
it needs oiling.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If you do not have a fully enclosed chain, I would check 
the chain every time it rains when its dried.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I found (without a fully enclosed chain) its not mileage 
that effects when you need to oil the chain, its time and rain.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To oil the chain, make sure it has no water on it, it's 
probably best to oil the chain when it's hot just after a ride.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Spray the chain with oil on the inside (the side that makes 
contact with the sprockets), the oil will fling outwards when bike is used and 
oil the outside.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Do not spray the outside of the chain since it will just 
fling off and create a mess every ware.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The best advice is to oil a chain often but not with a lot 
of oil.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Chain oil is slippery so wipe off any that gets on to the 
tyre.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Do not ride the bike for at least 1 hour afterwards, else 
the oil will immediately fling off.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The better the chain oil, the more it will stick on (not 
fling off), it will also last longer and resist water.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Chain Tension should be 20mm (can be 10 to 20mm) in the 
middle of the chain at the tightest spot.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To measure, put a ruler or stick (with marks on it) next to 
the middle of the chain (just in front of the rear passenger foot rest?).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Put your finger under the chain and try to pull it up until 
you feel slight resistance.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Move the back wheel slightly and recheck the chain, keep 
doing this until you find the tightest spot.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The chain tightness is
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">affected</span> by 
how much oil is on the chain.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To adjust the chain tension, slacken the right hand rear 
wheel axle nut (22mm ?).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Their are 2 adjusters, one on each side of the axle, they 
both have 2 nuts (12 ? and 10mm ?, the one on the end is a locking nut).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Put a spanner on both nuts at the same time, and slacken 
the end one.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Repeat this on the other adjuster.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Tighten both adjusters by the same amount of turns (or 
wheel alignment will go out), recheck chain tension.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The adjusters should point to little marks on the frame, 
they should be the same on both sides or the wheel alignment will be wrong.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If your wheel alignment has been set perfectly (part of the 
MOT), you do not need to worry about the marks.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One of the adjusters should point to a label on the frame 
that has a wear indicator, when it says it's worn out replace the chain.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When tightening the rear axle nut, </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">push the rear wheel in to the bike with your left hand 
while tightening with your right hand, </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">do not try to tighten the adjuster nuts, just lock the 
locking nuts in place, </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">to check that the adjuster nuts are tight, try to put a 
piece of paper between them and the frame.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Recheck chain tension and repeat procedure if necessary.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The original chain on the front disc brake model is O ring 
type, this costs several times more money than a non O ring chain, </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">but it lasts several times longer and keeps the internal 
oil inside it due to the O rings. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I advise you stick to  the manufacturers choice. Of 
course a X ring is even better than a O ring but costs even more.</p>

it or you can not clean it.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the UK for example the air is clean enough that you may 
never or hardly ever need to clean the filter for the life of the engine.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You can always have a look at the Air Filter to see if it 
needs cleaning or replacing (the cleaning instructions below will show you how).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">But you can also simply check the spark plug or check it 
when the engine runs rich (looses power and other things),</p>

Make sure the foam is 100% dry then soak in SAE 80 gear oil, SAE 90 gear oil or 
SAE 30 (often sold for Lawn Mowers) engine oil.<br>
<br>
Gently Squeeze out excess oil (else exhaust will smoke until it's burned off).<br>

<p class="MsoNormal">The following applies to the front disc brake model. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I would advise you to also try it with the old model, </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">but do not expect to have to adjust it by such a large 
amount or have such a warming up problem in the first place,</p>

mixture, so if you are in any doubt that the filter is clogged, clean it.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The fuel mixture is set incredibly lean when idling by the 
manufacturer (to reduce pollution). </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This results in the engine taking forever to warm up, cools 
down very quickly needing choke again and hesitation when opening the throttle. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The dealer may have adjusted it if your lucky. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If not, fully warm the bike up = 10 miles or more at high 
speed at the end (40mph for 5 miles does not warm it up). </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Make sure the outside temperature is between 14c and 30c 
and you're near sea level (not up a mountain).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Look under the carburettor and find the screw (front right 
hand side of bike, its the screw sticking out and is not tight), adjust it until you get the fastest idle.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1/4 turn will make a difference, adjust the screw and then 
wait a few seconds for the engine to react, blipping the throttle is some times needed. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When you have found the fastest idle, you will find that 
even opening and closing the screw 1/4 turn, will slow the engine down.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If you have trouble hearing if the engine has increased or 
decreased in speed,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">ask some one to stand the other side of the bike or behind 
the bike (listen to the silencer)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The screw would originally be set to about 1 and 3/4 turns 
open. Mine ended up at 3 1/4 turns open.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You may then need to adjust the idling speed screw if the 
idling speed is to high, but whenever you touch it, 
recheck the mixture screw setting again.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If you open the Idle Mixture Screw to many turns, it will 
fall out, </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">simply push it back in (it does have a spring and washers 
inside that will fall off if turned upside down).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If the screw is on the fall out turn part, vibration may make it rotate 
slightly and drop out.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I have had no trouble at 3 1/4 turns open, its still got 
over 1 whole turn to go before it would fall out.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">look half way down the side panel and then just to the 
right of the side panel. See that small black plastic box.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There's a small flat headed screw on the left hand side of it

<p class="MsoNormal">then speed it up a fraction more.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The whole idea about what speed to set the idle, on any 
motorbike engine is the following.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To slow and the bike will stall, nearly fast enough and the 
engine will splutter or stall now and again.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To fast and the engine will overheat in a traffic jam and 
burn more petrol than needed.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The gear change is also effected by idle speed, to fast or 
slow will effect how smooth it is or even stop you changing gear in extreme 
cases.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I expect the salt water and excessive braking has made the disc 
rough.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A Honda mechanic new about this problem and mentioned you 
could buy brake pads with metal in them to do the same job as salt water.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When the brake pads wear out, changing them is  simple, search the internet 
for information.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If the brake is excessively binding, you need to clean the brake, again 
its simple, search the internet for information.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Brake fluid changing, I advise you to change the fluid if 
it’s a new bike before the 2 year schedule, </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I changed it 2 months early and noticed a substantial 
improvement in power and feel.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There are several different ways to change the fluid, </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">you can buy a one way valve brake bleeding system for less 
than £10 and instructions are included.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Its pretty easy and I recommend you try it, just remember 
brake fluid eats paint so cover it up.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The smallest bottle of DOT 3 or 4 brake fluid is needed.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Any brake bleeding device will come with plastic tubing to 
connect to the brake, if you do not buy anything,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">you will need transparent clear plastic tubing 
with an internal diameter of 5mm, available from motor shops and maybe DIY and 
fish tank shops.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The instructions below are how I replaced the brake fluid, 
it's a combination of the one way valve system and the non one way valve system.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The instructions might make it look hard and complicated, 
but it really is very easy, lots of the instructions are not needed,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">their just in case something goes wrong (unlikely).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I used the metal one way valve (look for the arrow on it, 
for the direction of flow) with transparent clear plastic tubing on each end 
(small tube = brake end).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The plastic tubing was very determined to stay in its 
coiled up state, you need someone to help you  keep it straight,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">or you could trap it (I put it through a large funnel which 
I trapped in the handle of a large bucket).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1. Remove the small black rubber cap on the brake bleed nipple 
(disc end of brake) and attached the small tube.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">2. Unscrew and remove the brake fluid reservoir lid, theirs 
a second lid inside that you need to pull out.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">3. Pull the brake lever in slowly (as far as you can 
without excessive force) and slowly release, repeat this 3 or 4 times to get the 
pressure up,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then pull it in again slowly and hold 
while very slowly opening the brake bleed nipple nut (the pressure on the 
brake lever will reduce, </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; keep pressure on lever, when lever hits 
handle bars, keep it their), as soon as fluid flows easily in to the transparent 
pipe, stop opening the nut.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the fluid stops moving, close the 
nut and only then release the brake lever slowly.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">4. Repeat step 3 until brake fluid has gone through the one 
way valve.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">5. You can now leave the nut open and slowly pull the brake 
lever in and slowly release over and over until nearly all the fluid is out of 
the reservoir,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; do not let air get in to the small pipes 
in the bottom of the reservoir or you will get air in to the system.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">6. Make sure you have covered everything around the 
reservoir since you may spill the brake fluid, which eats paint, even a single 
drop.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pour new brake fluid in 
to the reservoir (must be an unopened bottle, it goes off as soon as it's 
opened).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Keep repeating step 5 and put new brake fluid in 
when needed, when the colour of the fluid in the transparent tube changes,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you have replaced all the old fluid in 
the brake system, if you do not notice the colour change,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you must have changed all the fluid when 
most of the small bottle is used.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">7. If the brake lever looses all or some of its pressure, 
you have let air in to the system, repeat step 3 to get it out.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">8. The fluid in the transparent tubing before the one way 
valve should not have any bubbles or foaming in it, if it does you need to get them 
out,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you can try step 3 again, you may also 
need to experiment with the bleed nut (try opening it less or more),</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you may also have to try closing the 
brake bleed nut before the brake lever touches the handle bars.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">9. When finished, make sure brake bleed nut is closed tight 
and top up the reservoir (never let it drop below the Lower mark).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">10. Put reservoir lid back on and then the outside lid, you 
do not need to tighten screws very hard since its all rubber, </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; remember how easy it was to 
unscrew.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">11. Any brake fluid that has been spilt needs to be diluted 
with loads of water to stop it eating things, </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it's normal for some brake 
fluid to have escaped around the brake bleed nut.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">12. If you have trapped air in the brake system (unlikely), the brake will have a lack of pressure and feel spongy.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If step 8 does not fix this 
problem, the air is trapped higher up the system, you need to make sure the 
brake bleed nut is closed tight,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then slowly pull the brake lever in 
until it touches the handle bar, then tie the lever to the handle bar while it's 
still touching, leave it like that overnight.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then open the bleed nut 
slowly and hopefully the air will come out. If this still does not totally work, 
try again, the reservoir lid might need to stay off overnight.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">6mm Allen Key (6 sided hex key)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">10mm spanner</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">8mm spanner (high quality, else it will not grip the nut 
well enough to turn), not needed for front drum brake models.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">14mm socket</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Feeler gauge (available from most motor shops, thin pieces 
of metal of different thicknesses, must measure 0.08mm or 0.003 inch)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Torch</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Magnifying Glass (depends on your eye sight)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1. Leave bike overnight to cool down, this is essential 
since the valve clearance changes with a hot engine.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">2. Remove the two round Allen (hex) key covers on the left hand 
side of the engine case.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (If they will not undo, warm the bike up and then try, 
once they are off leave bike overnight to cool down again).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The big one is for turning over the engine (you might 
be able to use rear wheel + 5<sup>th</sup> gear instead)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The small one is were the marks for valve clearance and 
timing are (T is for valve and F for timing)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">3. You can remove the spark plug to aid turning over the 
engine but not really needed.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">4. Turn the engine over anticlockwise with a 14mm socket 
until a small on its side T is displayed on the outside of</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the disc (you will need a torch and magnifying glass), 
line the mark below the T up with the grove at the top of the hole.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 18.0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ignore all of steps 5 (5, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3) if you have the 
front drum brake model.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">5. &nbsp;&nbsp;To remove the valve cover you first need to remove the 
air box attached to the valve cover (its on the top of the engine, left side) =</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">5.1 Slide the rubber air pipe out of the metal hook on the 
bikes metal frame (underneath the petrol tank).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">5.2 Remove the two main bolts (10mm) attaching the air box 
to the valve cover.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">5.3 Remove the two 8mm bolts attaching the air pipe to the 
top of the valve cover (pipe has a rubber washer), </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; slide air box + pipes away from valve cover / bike.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the spanner can not grip,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; try a better quality spanner 
or warm the bike up and then try (let the bike cool down overnight again before 
checking valve clearance)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or remove the petrol tank &amp; 
use a socket set / may need an extra thin extension shaft.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To remove petrol tank</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make sure petrol on/off/reserve tap is off &amp; detach 
petrol fuel hose from petrol on/off/reserve tap </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;remove left side panel of bike, unclip right side 
panel where it clips in to petrol tank</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unclip petrol tank electrical connection and un hook 
wire from the bikes metal frame</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; remove seat (2 nuts 
underneath rear mud guard on the sides), remove bolt holding tank, remove tank 
by pulling it towards rear of bike and up</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">6. Remove the valve cover, its on the very top of the 
engine, two bolts on the right and one on the left (10mm), </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there's a rubber gasket inside a grove 
inside the lid (do not lose or damage / trap it). </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You will find there is a technique to 
getting the valve cover off, it gets caught on the bikes metal frame and also 
the valves inside. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may think its impossible to get out, 
but there is a way, keep trying all the different angles till you find the 
technique, brute force does not work.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">7. Check that you can rock the valves, if you can not, you are on 
the wrong engine stroke, simply repeat step 4</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you can not work out if the valves 
are rocking, they will only rock if there's some valve clearance. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If your on the wrong stroke there's no 
valve clearance.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">8. &nbsp;The valve clearance should be set to = 0.08mm (0.003 
in), this applies to all Honda CG125 models, their are only 2 valves. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a feeler gauge is available from 
most motor shops like Halfords, a feeler gauge is 
just a set of metal plates of various thicknesses.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the valve clearance is correct, 
the feeler gauge will feel very slight resistance when moving through the gap.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you find the valves need to be 
adjusted, its worth trying to turn the engine over several times (repeat step 4 
twice then check and repeat)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  to see if it then is 
correct, theirs always a slight variation every time you turn the engine over.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To adjust a valve, loosen the nut on the valve you 
wish to adjust, use pliers (or hand) to turn the top of the screw</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thread (or obtain the proper tool) 
until the clearance is at the desired amount, then re tighten nut.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recheck valve clearance after re 
tightening the nut, if its gone out, loosen nut again and readjust.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Check valve clearance every 2,000 miles until it 
settles down then every 4000</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">9. Reassemble everything in reverse order, but make sure 
the rubber air hose is not trapped on the inside when </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; attaching air box to valve cover (does 
not apply to front drum brake model since it does not have one).</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><a name="Ignition Timing"></a>Ignition Timing</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">All the 1995 ? (S &amp; T models) onwards, Honda CG125 bikes have Electronic Ignition, 
also known as <font FACE="TimesNewRoman" SIZE="3">Capacitor Discharge or CDI,
</font><font face="TimesNewRoman">it requires no maintenance.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="TimesNewRoman">The only reason to change the 
Electronic Ignition Timing setting, is to bodge a worn out engine (if you are to lazy to 
replace the worn out parts).</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="TimesNewRoman">Some people change the 
Electronic Ignition 
Timing setting to try to get more power out of the engine, not advised, this is 
not a sports bike engine.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="TimesNewRoman">If you have a  Honda CG125 before 
1995 (before S &amp; T models) it could still have the old Points system, this requires maintenance 
a bit like the Valve Clearance.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="TimesNewRoman">The Points system is very easy 
and cheap to replace with Electronic Ignition, its very common for any make or 
model of bike to be converted.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="TimesNewRoman">The Points system is also less 
reliable and does not work as well as Electronic Ignition (lack of power at some 
engine revs).</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="TimesNewRoman">If you have the Points system I 
can only give you very basic information, search the internet or get the Haynes 
Workshop Manual if you need more help.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="TimesNewRoman">The Points are behind the left 
hand engine cover.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="TimesNewRoman">Follow steps 1 to 4 from the 
<a href="#Valve clearance">Valve clearance</a> section above, but instead of aligning up the T, align up F.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="TimesNewRoman">The points gap should be 0.3 mm (0.012

replace the Headlight Bulb</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">For information about different headlight bulbs, see 
<a href="Accessories.htm#Headlight Bulb">Headlight Bulb</a> 
in <a href="Accessories.htm">Accessories</a> page.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The following is for the Front Disc brake model, I would 
not be surprised if it was also correct for the Front Drum brake model, but 
check in case.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The original bulb is a 12v 35/35w incandescent type with a 
BA20d connection to the bulb holder.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Remove the 2 screws underneath the headlight (just behind 
the chrome rim), they will be very tight.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Both screws will have a washer and a plastic tube that goes 
through the hole, make sure you get both of them out as well.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Pull the bottom of the chrome rim away from the bike to 
remove the headlight (this will be hard so use brute force).</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">When you have removed the headlight, you will find the 
headlight wire half way along, has a connector, remove the connector (it has a 
little clip).</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The headlight should now be totally disconnected from the 
bike.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Look at the rubber bulb holder, theirs a small spring 
connecting it to the headlight, remove the spring at that end.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Pull the rubber away at the edges, then lift the bulb 
holder out, it has a little piece of metal sticking in to a slot in the 
headlight at the opposite end to the spring.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">You should now put a pair of clean gloves on, this is 
critical if you are touching a Halogen bulb, its also recommended for any bulb.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I use normal disposable gloves, that are totally clean, if 
you touch the bulb without gloves, you must clean it with a soft cloth and 
mentholated spirit.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">If you do not clean it, the bulb is likely to fail 
(overheat and destroy itself) when you use it next.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">To remove the bulb, push it in to the bulb holder and twist 
it anti clockwise.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">To put a new bulb in, you will find it will only go in one 
way round, the 2 bayonet arms are different sizes.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">You may think a Halogen bulb has so much metal you would 
not touch the glass / plastic sensitive part, but its impossible, you must wear 
gloves.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Push the new bulb in to the bulb holder and twist 
clockwise.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Find the little piece of metal sticking out of the bulb 
holder (opposite side to the spring), put it in the slot in the headlamp.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Push the rubber back in to place to create a seal, 
reconnect the spring to the headlight.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Reconnect the headlamp wire connector to the bike.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Put headlamp back in to bike and line up the screw holes 
and put the 2 screws back in with the bits that were with it.</p>
