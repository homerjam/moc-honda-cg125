        <p>
          The following applies to the front disc brake model.<br />
          I would advise you to also try it with the front drum model,<br />
          but do not expect to have to adjust it by such a large amount or have such a warming up problem in the first place,<br />
          since it does not have such strict emission regulations.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img alt="" height="200" src="images/screwdriver_bit.jpg" style="float: left" width="76" />
        </p>
        <p class="down-70px">
          Tools required,<br />
          a small flat headed screwdriver bit<br />
          (it must not have a handle since it would hit the bike and so not fit)
        </p>
        <p class="under-img">
          If the Air Filter is clogged up, it will affect the mixture, so if you are in any doubt that the filter is clogged, clean it,<br />
          see <a href="servicing.htm#Air-Filter">Air Filter</a> in <a href="servicing.htm">Servicing</a> page.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fuel mixture is set incredibly lean when idling by the manufacturer (to reduce emissions).<br />
          This results in the engine taking forever to warm up<br />
          as well as hesitation when opening the throttle (even when fully warmed up).<br />
          The engine also needs the choke on again to start the engine even when it has been switched off for a short time.
        </p>
        <p>
          The dealer may have adjusted it if you're lucky.
        </p>
        <p>
          If not, fully warm up the engine = 15 miles or more with the last 10 miles at 50mph or faster<br />
          (40mph for 5 miles does not warm it up).
        </p>
        <p>
          Make sure the outside temperature is between 14c and 30c and you're near sea level (not up a mountain).
        </p>
        <p>
          <img alt="" height="300" src="images/idle_mixture_screw.jpg" style="float: left" width="400" />
        </p>
        <p class="down-30px">
          Look under the carburettor and find the screw<br />
          (right hand side of the bike,<br />
          it's the screw sticking out and is not tight),<br />
          adjust it until you get the fastest idle.
        </p>
        <p>
          1/4 turn will make a difference,<br />
          adjust the screw and then wait a few seconds for the engine to react,<br />
          blipping the throttle is sometimes needed.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you have found the fastest idle,<br />
          you will find that even opening and closing the screw 1/4 turn,<br />
          will slow the engine down.
        </p>
        <p class="under-img">
          If you have trouble hearing if the engine has increased or decreased in speed,<br />
          ask someone to stand the other side of the bike or behind the bike (listen to the silencer)
        </p>
        <p>
          The screw would originally (front disc brake model) be set to about 1 and 3/4 turns open.<br />
          I ended up setting mine to 3 and a 1/4 turns open in order to get the fastest idle.
        </p>
        <p>
          After setting the idle mixture screw,<br />
          you may need to adjust the <a href="#Idle-speed-screw">Idle speed screw</a> (see below) if the idle speed is to high,<br />
          but whenever you adjust the idle speed screw, recheck the idle mixture screw setting again.<br />
          Because it may need adjusting again.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you open the Idle Mixture Screw to many turns, it will fall out,<br />
          you can simply push it back in (it does have a spring and washers inside that will fall off if turned upside down).<br />
          If the screw is on the fall out turn part, vibration may make it rotate slightly and drop out.<br />
          I have had no trouble at 3 and a 1/4 turns open, it has still got over 1 whole turn to go before it would fall out.<br />
          I class one turn as 360 degrees.
        </p>

          The Owner's Manual shows a picture of where it is.

        </p>
        <p class="down-60px">
          On the front disc brake model,<br />
          look at the right hand side of the bike,<br />
          look at the right hand side panel,<br />
          look half way down the side panel<br />
          and then just to the right of the side panel.
        </p>
        <p>
          See that small black plastic box.
        </p>
        <p>
          There's a small flat headed screw<br />
          on the left hand side of it<br />
          (almost touching the side panel),<br />
          that is the Idle Speed screw.
        </p>
        <p class="under-img">
          Fully warm up the engine = 15 miles or more with the last 10 miles at 50mph or faster<br />
          (40mph for 5 miles does not warm it up).<br />
          Slow the engine idle speed down to the point where it starts to thump during one of its cycles,<br />
          then speed it up until it stops thumping,<br />
          then speed it up a fraction more.
        </p>
        <p>
          The whole idea about what speed to set the idle, on any motorbike engine is the following.<br />
          To slow and the bike will stall, nearly fast enough and the engine will splutter or stall now and again.<br />
          Too fast and the engine will overheat in a traffic jam and burn more petrol than needed.<br />
          The gear change is also effected by idle speed;<br />
          to fast or slow will affect how smooth it is or even stop you changing gear in extreme cases.<br />
          The difference in overheating speed and stalling speed is large, so you only have to roughly set the idle speed.
