          GORE-TEX Motorcycle Coat / Jacket Review
        </h1>
        <p>
          This review is not about a particular brand or model of coat (since they keep changing),<br />
          instead it will show you what a massive difference a GORE-TEX lined coat makes to motorcycling<br />
          as well as the benefits of finding an aerodynamic coat (low wind resistance).
        </p>
        <p>
          GORE-TEX is the top brand name for waterproof, windproof, breathable liners and are famous around the world,<br />
          for all types of outdoor clothing including walking, cycling, skiing etc.<br />
          Walk in to any mountain clothing shop and they will tell you how it is the very top of the range and the best.
        </p>
        <p>
          A motorcycle coat is subjected too much harsher conditions than nearly all other activities,<br />
          due to the speed of the rain hitting it or the extreme cold due to wind chill or the extreme heat in summer.<br />
          So the massive benefits of the GORE-TEX liner really is needed and used all the time (as you will see in this review).
        </p>
        <p>
          The coat reviewed below is no longer manufactured (finished around 2011),<br />
          it was made by Hein Gericke and was called the Nagano.<br />
          It was the cheapest one they made and used a GORE-TEX Performance Shell liner,<br />
          the liner was the bottom of the GORE-TEX range and so detached from the outside fabric of the coat.<br />
          The entire coat was built down to the cheapest price I have ever seen a motorcycle GORE-TEX coat,<br />
          Â£199 in 2009 and was made in Vietnam.<br />
		  All Hein Gericke stores in the UK were closed down or sold to their competitors in 2012 and 2013.<br />
		  The Hein Gericke brand (a German company) was purchased by a Chinese company in late 2013 or early 2014.
        </p>
        <p>
          Trying to find a GORE-TEX lined coat today for that price could be very difficult, but there are often sales from time to time.<br />
          And I expect you will find the coats use more expensive materials making them more luxurious etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img alt="" height="322" src="images/nagano_coat.jpg" style="float: left" width="350" />
        </p>
        <p>
          This textile coat stands out from all the rest (including leather)<br />
          for the following reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fit, it's tight making it very aerodynamic (low wind resistance),<br />
          including the arms, the coat is more aerodynamic than many leather coats.<br />
          Also has the advantage of making you look thinner and smart<br />
          (like a tailored business suit).
        </p>
        <p>
          Waterproof yet much more breathable<br />
          than lesser materials thanks to its GORE-TEX liner.
        </p>
        <p>
          Light weight and small.
        </p>
        <p>
          Has a removable thermal lining for winter.
        </p>
        <p>
          High quality.
        </p>
        <h2 class="under-img">
          Aerodynamics (wind resistance)
        </h2>
        <p>
          This textile coats shape, tight fit and lack of bulk slices through the wind incredibly well (including side wind),<br />
          much better than my existing high end motorcycle leather coat<br />
          (which claims to be sports fit, but I would say it's in the middle of sports and normal).<br />
          Despite being a textile coat, it is rigid in the wind like a leather coat (does not distort or flap like a normal textile coat).
        </p>
        <p>
          The brilliant aerodynamics of this coat really shows what all motorcyclists need in a coat.<br />
          And also shows how terrible the aerodynamics are in the majority of other motorcycle coats (excluding the sports leather ones).<br />
          It does not matter if you're a learner on a 125cc bike<br />
          or an advanced motorcyclist on a 1000cc bike at over 100mph on the motorway,<br />
          we all suffer from the wind. We ether suffer from high wind speed or we generate it by riding fast.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most motorcyclists (non-sports riders) do not realise what a massive difference there is between riding a bike,<br />
          with an aerodynamic coat verses a normal motorcycle coat.<br />
          They only realise something's wrong when the wind speed is so high they get blown around (by side wind),<br />
          buffeted or fatigue sets in due to fighting the bike.<br />
          They normally blame the wind speed, the distance they have travelled, their own speed or the bike, not realising it's their coat.<br />
          They also do not realise the problem also substantially effects how easy,<br />
          enjoyable and the amount of fatigue they get at much lower speeds.<br />
          Some people will think, get a big touring bike with a big screen and it will deflect all the wind away from the coat,<br />
          that never works 100% ether (arms, back etc.).
        </p>
        <p>
          The best way to try and explain all this is, try riding your bike at 40mph when the wind speed is 0mph or 5mph max.<br />
          The wind will hardly have any effect on you or the bike,<br />
          your only problem is boredom setting in and you're not moving much (so seat ache etc. may set in) over distance.<br />
          Then try 50 to 60mph when the wind speed is 20mph or higher, headwind as well as side wind. Can you tell a difference?<br />
          I bet everyone will notice a substantial difference.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now imagine this, get a normal motorcycle coat and ride in a strong wind<br />
          (try side and head wind as well as going round corners),<br />
          then try this aerodynamic motorcycle coat on the same stretch of road immediately after words<br />
          (so wind speed does not change),<br />
          and I bet you will swear the wind speed has dropped massively (or at least substantially),<br />
          over 50% speed reduction can easily appear to happen.<br />
          So to convince yourself that the wind has not dropped, put your normal motorcycle coat back on and try again,<br />
          it really is amazing the difference.
        </p>
        <p>
          The secrets to the incredible aerodynamics is pretty simple and basic.<br />
          Tight fit, stiff material in the right places,<br />
          lack of bulk (so makes you thinner) and not letting the coat blow up inside due to air pressure.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tight fit aerodynamics can be seen in the shop to a degree.<br />
          Put a coat on and look at yourself in a mirror,<br />
          ideally you need another person to look at you (women seem to be the best at this test).<br />
          Does the coat make you look thinner than a normal motorcycle coat?<br />
          Then turn to your side and look at your arm (this is the side wind test),<br />
          how thin does your arm look at the side of your body?<br />
          Now imagine the wind pushing the side of your arm,<br />
          is there much baggy material that will push flat creating a large surface area like the sail on a sailing boat?
        </p>
        <h2>
          Breathability
        </h2>
        <p>
          The breathability of the GORE-TEX (waterproof) makes it better than leather according to my tests<br />
          (even leather with massive ventilation zips).<br />
          I have tested cheaper waterproof materials than GORE-TEX,<br />
          often only in the shop and was unimpressed with the breathability results,<br />
          GORE-TEX really is worth the extra money<br />
          (GORE-TEX is famous as being the best for breathability in other sports like mountain walking, skiing etc.)
        </p>
        <p>
          You can try this for yourself in a motorcycle shop,<br />
          try a GORE-TEX coat on and zip it up all the way (if it has a removable thermal lining, remove it first).<br />
          Then try a coat with a cheaper waterproof liner than GORE-TEX.<br />
          The coats will be at room temperature (not your body temperature) when you try them on,<br />
          but you should still get an idea after a few minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The best example to show how good GORE-TEX breathability is, is to try a pair of gloves on in the shop,<br />
          then try some with a lesser waterproof material and then try some with no waterproof material.<br />
          The differences in breathability should be obvious after only a few minutes, some people will realise in seconds.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Waterproof
        </h2>
        <p>
          I have used the coat in a torrential downpour at 60mph for 30 minutes in a strong headwind.<br />
          The rain was so heavy the road was totally flooded (standing water on entire road surface).
        </p>
        <p>
          The coat was totally waterproof, even though the rain was angled towards the coat due to the wind and bike speed.<br />
          Not only was it totally waterproof, but due to the high breathability of the GORE-TEX liner it was totally fresh inside,<br />
          no sign of the usual cold humid moist atmosphere you get with low / non breathable waterproofs.<br />
          And the coat did not soak up much water; even the outside of the coat was resistant to most of it.<br />
          This resulted in the coat hardly increasing in weight and drying very quickly.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am sure the coat could have been used for a much longer ride than I had,<br />
          the GORE-TEX liner is brilliant, just ask anyone in the waterproof clothing industry (mountain, skiing, motorcycle etc.).
        </p>
        <h2>
          Hot Weather
        </h2>
        <p>
          This coats brilliant breathability really shows on very hot days,<br />
          it really does keep you cool even in the baking sun when riding the bike.<br />
          Even when loads of other motorcyclists have resorted to riding with just a t shirt on.<br />
          The breathability is a bit like air conditioning in a car,<br />
          gets the moisture away from your body and breaths so you do not suffer from humidity.
        </p>
        <p>
          When off the bike on very hot days the coat does become too hot and humid, especially when walking,<br />
          but considering no one else can stand wearing any coat due to the heat on such a hot day, you cannot blame the coat.<br />
          But the brilliant thing is this coat is so light, thin and small (especially with the original body armour replaced or removed),<br />
          you can take it off and throw it over your shoulder and hardly notice it's there.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Winter / Cold Weather
        </h2>
        <p>
          This coat is very good at stopping the cold wind getting through,<br />
          due to the GORE-TEX liner and double zip system<br />
          (you have one zip for the outside of the coat and another for the internal GORE-TEX liner).
        </p>
        <p>
          The removable thermal lining works very well at insulating you from the cold.<br />
          On a 65 mile ride at -1c to -3c, headwind and no sun there was no sign of cold.<br />
          My chest did feel a little cool when I deliberately breathed in excessively (as a test)<br />
          to remove the insulating air trapped inside the coat.<br />
          There was not even any cold wind getting to my neck,<br />
          even though I was not wearing anything to protect it underneath the coat.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was only wearing a thin mountain base layer underneath it (a bit like a shirt but more high tech and better).<br />
          Even if the thermal lining is not good enough in extreme cold,<br />
          it can always be removed and a thick mountain fleece worn instead.<br />
          Depending on how tight the fit is, you can also buy from a mountain shop what's called a mid-layer, which is a thin fleece.<br />
          With all those different combinations and thermals, mountain base layers etc.<br />
          it should be very good no matter how cold the weather.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even with the thermal lining in, the breathability of the coat was still very good,<br />
          resulting in the coat still being comfortable when the weather warms up in the day.<br />
          Even in the cold the breathability is still very useful,<br />
          it stops the humidity building up which would make you cold and damp inside the coat.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Tight Fit and Armour
        </h2>
        <p>
          The tight fit does not reduce the comfort for the rider when moving around.<br />
          Except for the big, thick, pretty hard body armour.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example it may (depends on your shape)<br />
          push the textile fabric against the other side of your elbow when moving your arms up to your helmet,<br />
          which may cause minor friction burns.
        </p>
        <p>
          Luckily the armour can be removed very easily (undo velcro and pull it out),<br />
          and you can buy much thinner / lighter / more flexible armour which offers equal protection (at Hein Gericke for example).
        </p>
        <p>
          Tight fitting armour from what I have read is far more desirable than loose fitting armour in an accident.<br />
          Nothing can be proved for sure since no one is going to crash test the theory,<br />
          but the idea is in an accident you do not want the armour to be pushed off the area it's meant to protect,<br />
          so it must be tightly fitted to your body.
        </p>
        <p>
          For now I have removed the original armour (including the back protector), hope to try alternative armour later.<br />
          Even without the armour,<br />
          the coat still has lots of other protection including the strength of the fabric and double fabric in the important areas.<br />
          With armour in I had trouble putting my crash helmet on,<br />
          especially with the coats main zip all the way up (the arms were too restrictive).
        </p>
        <h2>
          What to wear underneath the coat
        </h2>
        <p>
          Breathability is the key at any temperature (very cold, hot or in between),<br />
          cotton is bad in comparison to modern man made materials.
        </p>
        <p>
          I highly recommend for the ultimate in comfort and temperature regulation,<br />
          you wear between your skin and the coat what's known as a base layer<br />
          in the mountain shops or by another name in motorcycle shops.<br />
          I would go for full length arms like a shirt (not like a t shirt)<br />
          because the motorcycle coats liner is not as soft and luxurious (except when thermal lining is in).<br />
          I have never tried a thermal base layer, because they work my reducing the breathability.
        </p>
        <p>
          These base layers should claim to be highly breathable and moisture wicking.<br />
          And they really do work,<br />
          as soon as you try one on,<br />
          you will realise how breathable they are and over time<br />
          or when you exercise you will realise they are removing the excess moisture from your skin.<br />
          This makes them ideal at all temperatures, including the coldest days and the hottest ones.<br />
          They make you warmer in the coldest days and cooler in the hottest.<br />
          Don't be surprised if you find that you like them so much, you use them all the time and not just for motorcycling.
        </p>
        <p>
          The other advantages of these base layers is, they are very small and lightweight compared to cotton.<br />
          When washed,<br />
          they dry very quickly so you could even use only one every day and dry it overnight without the need of a dryer.<br />
          They are soft and smooth; some are silky smooth which also reduces friction between it and the coat.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Conclusion
        </h2>
        <p>
          I can say with confidence, this coat is the only one I recommend for everyone.<br />
          Even for learners and people on tight budgets, it really is worth the extra money.
        </p>
        <p>
          This coat is so good; I have ditched all my others and use it all year round.
