          GORE-TEX Motorcycle Trouser / Pant Review
        </h1>
        <p>
          This review is not about a particular brand or model (since they keep changing),<br />
          instead it is to show you what GORE-TEX lined trousers are capable of.
        </p>
        <p>
          GORE-TEX is the top brand name of a waterproof, windproof, breathable liner famous around the world,<br />
          for all types of outdoor clothing including walking, cycling, skiing etc.<br />
          Walk in to any mountain clothing shop and they will tell you how it is the very top of the range and the best.
        </p>
        <p>
          The item reviewed below is no longer manufactured (finished around 2011),<br />
          it was made by Hein Gericke and was called the Atlas.<br />
          It was the cheapest one they made and used a GORE-TEX Performance Shell liner,<br />
          the liner was the bottom of the GORE-TEX range and so detached from the outside fabric of the trousers.<br />
          The trousers were built down to the cheapest price I have ever seen motorcycle GORE-TEX trousers sold for,<br />
          less than Â£180 in 2009 and was made in Vietnam.<br />
		  All Hein Gericke stores in the UK were closed down or sold to their competitors in 2012 and 2013.<br />
		  The Hein Gericke brand (a German company) was purchased by a Chinese company in late 2013 or early 2014.
        </p>
        <p>
          Trying to find GORE-TEX lined trousers today for that price could be very difficult, but there are often sales from time to time.<br />
          And I expect you will find the trousers use more expensive materials making them more luxurious etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img alt="" height="673" src="images/atlas_trousers.jpg" style="float: left" width="300" />
        </p>
        <p class="down-100px">
          These trousers have the famous GORE-TEX liner that makes them,<br />
          very breathable and yet waterproof and windproof.
        </p>
        <p>
          I find GORE-TEX much more breathable than other waterproof materials.<br />
          Trousers are less important than a coat for breathability but it's still crucial.<br />
          Breathability is so important<br />
          I would ether recommend GORE-TEX or no waterproof material on a hot day,<br />
          or if you spend more than a few minutes in a shop.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can try this for yourself in a motorcycle shop, try the item on<br />
          (watch out for items with a removable thermal lining, since they will be warm).
        </p>
        <p>
          The best example to show how good GORE-TEX breathability is,<br />
          is to try a pair of gloves on in the shop,<br />
          then try some with a lesser waterproof material<br />
          and then try some with no waterproof material.<br />
          The differences in breathability should be obvious after only a few minutes,<br />
          some people will realise in seconds.
        </p>
        <p>
          The trousers are tight to get in to,<br />
          trying to get the zip all the way up takes a bit of effort.<br />
          But when they are done up,<br />
          due to elastic / stretchable parts the fit slackens and are not uncomfortable.
        </p>
        <p class="under-img">
          The breathability, feel, lightness and flexibility of these trousers is brilliant except like most motorcycle trousers,<br />
          they have had to put double material and armour on the knees and down to your boots, for protection in an accident.<br />
          The plus side to this is you have far more insulation on your knees in a cold wind.<br />
          I was not used to all this weight and did not like how it slightly rubbed my knees constantly when walking.<br />
          As well as requiring far more effort to lift my leg.<br />
          But I totally removed the problem by tucking the trousers in to some high boots (see <a href="cycko_boots.htm">Cycko III Boots
          Review</a>).<br />
          The rubbing problem can also be removed by wearing the thermal liner that comes with the trousers.
        </p>
        <p>
          The knee armour can also be removed to substantially reduce the weight (undo velcro and pull out armour).<br />
          The armour can be replaced with lighter, thinner and more flexible armour.<br />
          You can also adjust the height position of the armour in the trousers by opening or closing the velcro sections.
        </p>
        <p>
          The thermal lining works very well and gives the trousers a luxurious soft / smooth feel.<br />
          It even breaths very well. I had to wait 1 hour 30 minutes in a warm hospital waiting room.<br />
          And to my amazement I did not get hot or humid with the thermal lining.<br />
          It's very important on a winter's day and when it's too much hassle to take out the lining just for inside a building.<br />
          The thermal lining also works very well in the cold,<br />
          on a 65 mile ride at -1c to -3c, headwind and no sun there was no sign of cold.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have also used the trousers in a torrential rain downpour at 60mph for 30mins in a strong headwind.<br />
          The rain was so heavy the road was totally flooded (standing water on entire road surface).<br />
          The trousers were totally waterproof, even though the rain was angled towards them due to the wind and bike speed.<br />
          Not only were they totally waterproof, but due to the high breathability of the GORE-TEX liner it was totally fresh inside,<br />
          no sign of the usual cold humid moist atmosphere you get with low / non breathable waterproofs.<br />
          And it did not soak up much water, even the outside of the trousers were resistant to most of it.<br />
          This resulted in it hardly increasing in weight and drying very quickly.<br />
          I am sure the trousers could have been used for a much longer ride than I had,<br />
          the GORE-TEX liner is brilliant, just ask anyone in the waterproof clothing industry (mountain, skiing, motorcycle etc.).
        </p>
        <p>
          The quality and performance for the price is excellent, but these trousers are in the budget price range.<br />
          You cannot expect the quality and comfort of GORE-TEX trousers that cost 50% more than these.
        </p>
        <p>
          The question is, are these the best motorcycle trousers you can buy?<br />
          The answer is not for all uses, saying that no motorcycle trousers are suitable for all uses.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also use Motorcycle Denim Jeans; they are normal Denim Jeans with Kevlar inside (for protection).<br />
          The Kevlar does not change the jeans much, just makes them much safer in an accident (road rash).<br />
          As you probably know, Denim is very breathable, easy to walk in, sit down and work all day etc.<br />
          But they are terrible in the wet and cold, unless you put waterproofs over them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Out of all the different materials,<br />
          Denim Jeans and GORE-TEX Textile trousers are my most highly recommend materials.
        </p>
        <p>
          These trousers are so good; I plan to use them as my main pair of motorcycle trousers all year round.
