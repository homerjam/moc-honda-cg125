          Pirelli City Demon Motorcycle Tyre Review
        </h1>
        <p>
          The Pirelli City Demon tyres (tire) were fitted as standard (at the factory)<br />
          to my Honda CG125 motorcycle when I bought it brand new (front disc model) in 2005.<br />
          2.75 - 18 Front, 90 / 90 - 18 Rear.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have covered around 50,000 miles with tyres around those sizes on several different bikes between 100 and 250cc,<br />
          over many years (I passed my motorcycle test a long time ago).
        </p>
        <p>
          So I have experience in how such narrow tyres should perform (narrow tyres are normally found on most 50 to 250cc bikes).
        </p>
        <p>
          I did manage to wear the Pirelli City Demon tyres out after around 8000 miles<br />
          (mileage will vary depending on riding style and weight).
        </p>
        <p>
          My review below might make you think the tyres or bike were faulty or setup wrong,<br />
          I can confirm the bike and tyres were not faulty or setup wrong because,<br />
          I used the bike on a different make of tyre without any problems,<br />
          I tried an identical 2nd hand bike with Pirelli City Demon tyres on,<br />
          I also checked the tyre pressures and wheel alignment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Several years after my review below, someone with a Yamaha YBR125 (same tyres sizes) confirmed my findings.<br />
          And he had been through several sets of the tyres purchased over many years.<br />
          So that rules out any ideas that the tyres were faulty.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tyres are not as bad as many of the unbranded (or Chinese brands) of cheap tyres.<br />
          But I do not recommend them for anyone to use.
        </p>
        <h2>
          The Good
        </h2>
        <p>
          Never made me drop the bike, but that could have been due to me being so afraid of them and so riding slowly.<br />
          In the wet they still gripped (but I always ride very carefully on soaking wet roads).<br />
          They still grip well enough on painted white lines.
        </p>
        <h2>
          The Bad
        </h2>
        <p>
          As mentioned above the tyres and bike were not faulty or setup incorrectly.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Cornering (going round a bend) was terrible
        </h2>
        <p>
          I swear the front and rear tyres did not want to go round a bend together.<br />
          For example, a bend where the average to slow car driver takes at 40mph,<br />
          the rear tyre would make the rear of the bike including the riders seat wobble sideways (left and right)<br />
          several times throughout the corner (very un nerving).<br />
          The front tyre had to be forced to go round the bend at that speed,<br />
          requiring a lot of leaning and wrestling the handlebars to force it round the corner.<br />
          The best way to describe the problem is by watching motorcycle racing,<br />
          when they push the tyres to far in a bend you see the back tyre wobble all over the place.<br />
          If I took the bend at 30 mph there was no problem,<br />
          but car drivers behind would get very frustrated and get very close to the bike.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Braking
        </h2>
        <p>
          For example, you're in the middle of a city and approach a set of traffic lights at 30 mph, they start to turn red at the worst time.<br />
          So you have to stop quickly, not severely (if you had you could legally go through the red light in the UK).<br />
          The front tyre feels like it turns to jelly and squiggles left and right and makes the steering almost impossible to control<br />
          (you can keep it going straight ahead).
        </p>
        <h2>
          Cornering (part 2)
        </h2>
        <p>
          When you go round a bend slow enough not to get the rear tyre wobbling (like in part 1 above),<br />
          you would still have the other major problem with the front tyre.<br />
          You get locked in to the line you have set the bike to go round the bend.<br />
          If you need to alter the line when your part way though the bend it is extremely hard,<br />
          and it's often impossible to be accurate enough (tyre overreacts or does not react enough).<br />
          This makes for a really bad and dangerous riding experience<br />
          if you find the bend tightens up more than you were expecting or find something in the road.<br />
          A learner will suffer a lot from this problem, but even an experienced rider will suffer.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Rolling Resistance and Feel of the Road surface
        </h2>
        <p>
          The rolling resistance is bad.<br />
          The tyre also absorb lots of the feel of the road surface in a bad way,<br />
          it's like having thick jelly, absorbs energy but also wobbles slightly.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Conclusion
        </h2>
        <p>
          After riding these tyres for around 8000 miles I can thoroughly recommend you do not buy them (they are not even very cheap).
        </p>
        <p>
          Compared to all the other makes and models of tyres I have used over all the years,<br />
          the tyres are well below average but not the worst.
