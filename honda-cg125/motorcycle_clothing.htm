        </h2>
        <p>
          All you have to do to make an item 100% Water and Wind proof is to cover it in solid plastic.<br />
          Unfortunately this results in moisture building up on the inside, due to condensation as well as from your skin.<br />
          The area your coat covers suffers the most as well as your hands to a certain extent.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moisture is water, which conducts heat very well. Unlike air which is a good insulator.<br />
          In winter, the water will make you dramatically colder.<br />
          In summer, the water will stop your body from cooling down.<br />
          Since all human beings give off moisture in order to regulate their body temperature.
        </p>
        <p>
          So a breathable material is desperately needed in all weather conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The way a waterproof, windproof breathable liner works is pretty simple.<br />
          Get some plastic film and put loads of holes in it, the holes must be smaller than a drop of water.<br />
          But large enough to allow water vapour to travel through it.<br />
          Water is turned to vapour due to the heat of the human body.<br />
          Since heat likes to rise, the water vapour will be pushed out.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is what we call breathability, the amount of breathability depends on,<br />
          the size of the holes, the amount of holes as well as the temperature difference between the inside and the outside.<br />
          The cooler the outside temperature is, the better the breathability.
        </p>
        <p>
          The more windproof a material is, the more it will protect you from a cold wind.<br />
          But in summer the less windproof a material is, the more it will cool you down.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are many different brands and models of Waterproof Windproof Breathable Liners.<br />
          They are used in nearly all types of outdoor clothing.<br />
          The most famous, trusted and probably expensive is the GORE-TEX brand.
        </p>
        <p>
          GORE-TEX has a reputation for having massively better breathability than its competitors,<br />
          especially competitors who are much cheaper than them (often people claim it feels like twice the breathability).<br />
          They also have a reputation for being 100% waterproof from new and after many years use.
        </p>
        <p>
          All clothing that carry's the GORE-TEX guaranteed to keep you dry warrantee,<br />
          is guaranteed by GORE-TEX and they have checked and approved of all the other materials used in the clothing<br />
          as well as the manufacturing process of the clothing.<br />
          GORE-TEX demands such a high standard that you can buy any make and model of clothing and know it is of very high quality.<br />
          But this guarantee only covers what the item is designed for,<br />
          so a walking coat would not be expected to be waterproof on a motorcycle (due to the much higher wind speed).
        </p>
        <p>
          The much cheaper competitors to GORE-TEX also have a terrible reputation for not being waterproof or staying waterproof.<br />
          The first problem seems to be when it is manufactured, it only takes one mistake when sewing the liner in to an item,<br />
          to make a small hole in the liner. This small hole results in a massive amount of water getting in over time,<br />
          due to the speed of the motorcycle forcing the rain in to it.<br />
          This problem depends on the skill of the person sewing as well as what the item is, boots and gloves seem to be the hardest.<br />
          Then there is the question about durability, the waterproofing may fail after only a few months use or may last a few years.<br />
          Different items will have more wear and tear than others,<br />
          so durability is more important, boots and gloves seem to be the worst.
        </p>
        <p>
          Breathability in a motorcycle coat is incredibly important due to the extreme weather conditions,<br />
          due to the speed of the motorcycle, even at 40mph.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the sections below, you will see I have reviewed a GORE-TEX Coat, Trousers and Gloves.<br />
          GORE-TEX may be an expensive product, but as you will see, it will transform your motorcycling enjoyment,<br />
          as well as allow you to travel much longer distances at much lower temperatures as well as in hot temperatures.<br />
          My advice is if you cannot afford it, save up and buy a GORE-TEX Coat, it is by far the item that benefits the most,<br />
          and look out for the sales, they are often heavily discounted from time to time.<br />
          If you can stretch to a pair of GORE-TEX gloves, they are the 2nd item that benefits the most from a GORE-TEX liner.
        </p>
        <p>
          The boots review used a cheap GORE-TEX alternative and as you will read near the end, I ended up with water getting in<br />
          and it took a very long time to dry them out (due to the liner backfiring, trapping the water inside the boot).
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two main types of GORE-TEX liners. The cheapest one is not attached to the outside fabric.<br />
          The expensive one is bonded to the outside fabric (on the inside of the item).<br />
          The expensive GORE-TEX liner has lots of advantages, but the extra cost is often hard to justify.<br />
          Except in a glove, since you need to feel the controls of the bike and in glove form only the cost is not that much higher.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of the benefits of the expensive GORE-TEX liner include,<br />
          stops water from outside soaking in as far in to the item (so it does not get so heavy and dries quicker),<br />
          breathes better and cold wind cannot get as far in to the item etc.
        </p>

        <p>
          A 125cc bike is small and very underpowered above 50mph,<br />
          this means your biggest enemy is wind resistance, your coat is the biggest wind surface area.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have a big bike in the future,<br />
          assuming you travel at much higher speeds, wind resistance is still a problem due to your body being blown around.
        </p>
        <p>
          Different materials have massive differences in wind resistance,<br />
          but the shape, cut, bulk and fit of the coat makes a much larger difference.
        </p>
        <p>
          To see what a massive difference a coats wind resistance can have on you and the bike<br />
          as well as why a GORE-TEX lined coat will transform your motorcycling enjoyment throughout the year,<br />
          please read my <a href="nagano_coat.htm">GORE-TEX Coat Review</a>.
        </p>

          For information about leather coats, please read my <a href="leather_coats.htm">Leather Coats</a> page.
        </p>
        <p>
          General advice about coats and wind resistance.<br />
          A coat that flaps in the wind is also wind resistance, so get one that's stiff enough and tight enough to flap as little as possible.<br />
          Things like wool jumpers etc. might be much smaller and lighter, but their wind resistance is terrible.<br />
          Of course back wind or slipstreaming lorries can eliminate this problem.<br />
          Just make sure you stay well within your stopping distance!<br />
          The coats wind resistance also effects how much you're blown all over the road by side wind.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you use a textile coat, get one that is of sporty type fit, look at yourself in a mirror with it on and then try a leather coat
          on.<br />
          Look at how big your body looks as well as your arms (arms side on as well for side winds) and your shoulders.<br />
          The leather coat type of fit is what you are after; you need to find a textile coat that is as close to it as possible.<br />
          You also want a coat without any pockets sticking out.<br />
          I also highly recommend the coat has a waterproof, windproof, breathable liner.<br />
          As well as a removable thermal liner or enough room to wear a mountain / walking fleece underneath.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <a href="accessories.htm#Screen">Screen</a> that deflects as much air away from the coat as possible would also be a good idea.

        <p>
          Normal denim jeans with Kevlar in side are the most practical when it's not raining<br />
          (put <a href="#Water-Proofs">Water Proofs</a> over them when it's raining or starts to get cold).<br />
          They are normally sold as motorcycle jeans, the Kevlar is meant to replace leather for protection from road rash if you fall off.<br />
          Denim jeans with Kevlar are easy to walk in, breathes and are not hot in summer.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you do not use motorcycle trousers,<br />
          normal thick denim jeans offer some protection (but you're much safer with motorcycle trousers).

          <a name="Boots" id="Boots"></a>Boots
        </h2>
        <p>
          To find out how good a boot can be, as well as what to look out for in a boot and how to use them in the rain,<br />
          please read my <a href="cycko_boots.htm">Motorcycle Boots Review</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          The ultimate best thing to wear on your feet to control a motorcycle is good quality walking leather shoes.<br />
          But they offer, very, very little protection in an accident;<br />
          you do not want to even think about the injuries so a boot is the only option.<br />
          The reason a leather shoe is so good at controlling a motorcycle<br />
          is because it allows you to easily move your ankle up and down to change gear.<br />
          You also have good feel between your foot and the gear change lever<br />
          and when you get off the bike you can easily walk to your destination.
        </p>
        <p>
          So the challenge is can you get a boot that is as good,<br />
          the answer is no (except it will give you far more protection in an accident).<br />
          It's a physical impossibility, but some are much better than others.<br />
          It's not always a question of the most expensive is best,<br />
          because the manufacturer has to work out what's most important, protection, control or walking.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first thing to do is try on as many boots as you can.
        </p>
        <p class="hang-indent-1">
          1. Try walking in the shop with them,<br />
          if it's too hard to walk in them for any distance they are useless unless you do not plan to walk far in them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following tests can easily be simulated in the shop<br />
          by putting your hand on top of your left foot and pushing your foot upwards while your heel is on the floor.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. How well can you move your left foot up and down to change gear.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. How much feel is there between your foot and the gear change lever.
        </p>
        <p class="hang-indent-1">
          4. How much protection do they give in an accident.<br />
          All boots will give better protection than shoes.<br />
          The stiffer the boot / thicker the padding the better the protection.<br />
          A motorcycle boot should (not all do) have much more protection built in to the boot including.<br />
          Solid hard round discs that go around the ankles.<br />
          Some will also have shinbone protection.<br />
          There are many other things that may have been added to a motorcycle boot<br />
          to make them better in an accident and more practical for motorcycling.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. How good are the materials, quality of construction etc.
        </p>
        <p class="hang-indent-1">
          6. What are they going to be like in the wet and cold?<br />
          If the boots do not have any special water proof, windproof, breathable materials inbuilt (like GORE-TEX),<br />
          Wind and water can get through stitching, zips and laces easily.<br />
          You can of course put <a href="#Water-Proofs">Water Proofs</a> over the top.

        <h2>
          <a name="Gloves" id="Gloves"></a>Gloves
        </h2>
        <p>
          Gloves are a necessity,<br />
          if you fall off your instinct is to land with your hands (very damaging and painful even at very low speeds without gloves).<br />
          The main requirement is leather to stop road rash, a motorcycle glove normally has additional protection built in to the glove.<br />
          Some motorcycle gloves use special textile materials instead of leather that have anti road rash abilities,<br />
          do not use a non-motorcycle textile glove.
        </p>
        <p>
          The type and quality of motorcycle gloves you use<br />
          will have a very large effect on how well you can control the throttle, clutch and brake.<br />
          A learner is normally less sensitive to the motorcycle controls,<br />
          so it's even more important to have a glove that reduces the feel of the controls as little as possible.<br />
          An experienced motorcyclist will also want a glove like that to make it easier to control the bike.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the ultimate control of the throttle, clutch and brake you want no gloves on,<br />
          but it is very dangerous if you fall off or anything hits your hands.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ultimate glove would be the thinnest,<br />
          softest leather between your fingers and the controls and good stretch ability on the back of your fingers and knuckles.<br />
          On a hot summers day some gloves stick to the back of your hand making it very hard to smoothly operate the clutch<br />
          (brake and throttle also suffer).<br />
          So stretch ability / ventilation holes and or a material that does not stick to the back of the hand is useful.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the ultimate glove is only any use in warm weather with no rain.<br />
          Most motorcycle riders in the UK have discovered that most of the year the weather is not like that.<br />
          The old fashioned answer to this problem was to put an inner glove or liner inside the glove.<br />
          The inner glove / liner would serve to reduce wind chill (reduces the cold wind getting though the fabric)<br />
          and often have some water proof abilities.<br />
          The problem with the inner glove / liner was it slips and slides within the glove<br />
          making it very hard to accurately control the bike (especially the throttle).<br />
          The more it slips and slides the worse it is as well as how thick it is.<br />
          Another common problem was the breathability of the material<br />
          (sweaty hands are always a bad idea for trying to use the bike controls inside a glove).
        </p>
        <p>
          The breathability and waterproof problem has been greatly improved by the invention of GORE-TEX.<br />
          The slipping and sliding problem has been fixed by bonding the liner to the glove and is called GORE-TEX X-TRAFIT.<br />
          It's an expensive product but so worth the extra money,<br />
          because it means you have a windproof, waterproof, breathable lined glove with the feel and control of an unlined glove.<br />
          It also means you can use the same glove for most of the year,<br />
          in the very coldest winter days in the UK you may need to use a winter glove, please see <a href="pathan_evo3_glove.htm">3 Finger Winter
          Glove Review</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          When trying on gloves in a shop there are several things to test including.<br />
          Try touching your thumb to each finger to see how much feel you have.<br />
          Try wrapping your hand around your other hand (to simulate operating the throttle).<br />
          Try pretending your operating the clutch to see how easily the glove stretches at the back of your hand / knuckles / fingers.<br />
          When you take off the glove see if anything slips and slides within the glove.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example several years ago, I went in to a store and tried on 4 lined gloves.

        <p>
          Tour LT X-TRAFIT<br />
          Very similar to the X-TRAFIT Leather GORE-TEX above but not quite as good (also no visor wipe), Cost £79.99.
        </p>
        <p>
          ECO GTX II<br />
          This has the GORE-TEX liner but it's the old fashioned type = not bonded so it slips and slides, it also has no visor wipe.<br />
          Cost £59.99, I only tried one on in the shop, it's miles better than the Blader glove below,<br />
          but the X-Trafit gloves above are miles better than it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Blader<br />
          Cost £34.99 and has a Sheltex liner, it's not bonded and so slips and slides (but does have a visor wipe).<br />
          Sheltex is a competitor to GORE-TEX but costs less, it also claims to be windproof, waterproof and breathable.<br />
          But as soon as I tried it on in the shop after the GORE-TEX gloves above I could tell it's not on the same level,<br />
          but what do you expect at that price?<br />
          The quality of the materials and stitching etc. are still very good but it's the liner I did not like.<br />
          It felt thick (so reduced feel substantially)<br />
          it also did not breath anywhere near as good as the GORE-TEX (but I was in a shop that's often far worse than on the bike).<br />
          I personally would not wear a glove with a liner like this,<br />
          I would do everything possible to afford the X-Trafit or at least the ECO GTX II.<br />
          If I really could not afford to get the better gloves, I would look at an unlined glove.

        <h2>
          <a name="Eye-Sight"></a>Eye Sight
        </h2>
        <p>
          It is a very good idea to have your eyes tested even if you have never needed spectacles (glasses).<br />
          If you have never had an eye test,<br />
          it's a very good idea to have one no matter how good you think your eye sight is (it's common to think it's good when it's bad).<br />
          If you have never needed spectacles,<br />
          you should at least get your eyes tested once between the age of 20 to 25 and also once between 40 to 50.<br />
          After the age of 60 you really should get regular eye tests no matter how good your eye sight is<br />
          (above 70 years old is very high risk of eye problems).<br />
          For expert advice about ages, speak to someone who specialises in eye sight,<br />
          the person who does an eye test will be able to advise you the best.
        </p>
        <p>
          People often do not realise their eye sight is gradually getting worse over the years since their brain adapts.<br />
          If your long distance eye sight is affected,<br />
          how far you can see will get shorter and shorter gradually over the years often without you realising.<br />
          It's also common not to realise your brain slows your vehicle down, does not overtake vehicles unless there is a massive gap,<br />
          lorries are very hard at speed, pulling out of a junction or roundabout etc.<br />
          I assume you have seen this with 80 year old car drivers,<br />
          but it can happen to a 23 year old who never needed spectacles before.<br />
          The person who tested my eyes told me that people have a significant drop in eyesight at 20 to 25 years old<br />
          and some people need spectacles for the first time.
        </p>
        <p>
          The eye sight test for obtaining a driving licence in the UK is only a minimum requirement<br />
          and your eye sight has to be very bad to fail it.<br />
          Having a proper eye sight test at an opticians will be to a much higher standard.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you wear spectacles when riding,<br />
          I recommend you buy some with an anti-reflective coating, you will be able to see much further and better,<br />
          night riding is even better. An anti-scratch coating is a good idea unless you keep the visor down most of the time.
        </p>
        <h2>
          <a name="Helmet" id="Helmet"></a>Helmet
        </h2>
        <p>
          The best way (will not scratch) to clean the visor is with a spectacle (reading glasses)<br />
          or camera cleaning cloth (microfiber) with plenty of water (soak).
        </p>
        <p>
          The motorcycle helmet is the most important item, it's also the only item that is a legal requirement to be worn in the UK.
        </p>
        <p>
          A helmet wears out, it does not really age.<br />
          The polystyrene absorbs your sweat, as it does it loses its elasticity and hardens.<br />
          This makes the fit very loose, like the helmet is one or two sizes larger than when new.<br />
          When it gets too bad, you need to buy a new helmet.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most important thing is to get one that's the best fit, it does not matter if it's a £50 helmet or a £500 helmet,<br />
          if it's a bad fit, it will offer very little protection in an accident and will be noisy and uncomfortable.
        </p>
        <p>
          To find the best fitting helmet, you need to try every make and model at every price point.<br />
          Try as many shops as you can find, since they can stock different makes and models.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you think you have got the best fit, try the same make and model,<br />
          one size smaller and one size larger to confirm the correct size.<br />
          You then need a trained helmet assistant to check the helmet fit is safe, all shops should have at least one trained person.<br />
          They will check that the helmet is not too loose and that it cannot be turned around your head easily or rolled off,<br />
          you can check these for yourself but a trained assistant is better.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since most shops refuse to accept a helmet back once you leave the store unless it's faulty,<br />
          you should try it on in the shop for 15 to 20 minutes.<br />
          Watch out for pressure on your forehead (excessive pressure over minutes often stops you concentrating or thinking clearly),<br />
          or if you get a headache or when you take it off you notice excessive red marks on your forehead, it's too small.<br />
          You must leave the helmet on for 15 to 20 minutes for these problems to show up.<br />
          A helmet will very slightly, permanently squash to your head and face, but it's only slightly,<br />
          so a very slightly uncomfortable tight fit will change to a perfect fit (slightly tight).<br />
          A slightly loose fit when new will become very slightly looser.<br />
          The tighter the helmet, the safer it is in an accident,<br />
          but too tight and it's uncomfortable and can give you a splitting headache (could make you crash).<br />
          Never loan your helmet to someone else, since if any part of their head or face is larger than you,<br />
          it will permanently squash to that size at any age.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have a choice of helmets that are all the same perfect fit.<br />
          You might also like a removable liner so you can wash the liner that touches your head all the time,<br />
          you may also like a cooling / antibacterial one.<br />
          Generally the more expensive helmets have more sound insulation (but they will be noisier if they're a bad fit).
        </p>
        <p>
          If you live in the UK, fogging / misting up is often a problem in some weather conditions<br />
          (see <a href="riding_in_winter.htm#Helmet">Helmet</a> in <a href="riding_in_winter.htm">Riding in Winter</a> page).
        </p>
        <p>
          If your hearing is affected by motorcycling,<br />
          the normal thing is to wear motorcycle ear plugs to stop you permanently damaging your hearing.<br />
          If you have a non flip up helmet,<br />
          some shops sell an anti-wind noise fabric that fits underneath and around the bottom of the helmet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Flip up helmets are popular since you can speak to people easily and show your face (your hearing is still effected),<br />
          you can also eat and drink.<br />
          But the main reason is if you wear spectacles,<br />
          you do not have to remove them while putting the helmet on / off and risk the wind blowing them off the bike.

          <a name="Water-Proofs"></a>Water Proofs
        </h2>
        <p>
          You can buy motorcycle water proofs, but they often cost more just because they say for motorcycling.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can buy water proofs for walking, pedal cycling, fishing and other uses that will all work for motorcycling.<br />
          The only thing you need to look out for is how well sealed the front zips are, the front seams are also a weak point.<br />
          I tried a normal walking waterproof coat and the rain got through the main front zip.<br />
          I then tried a normal walking waterproof coat that claimed to be storm proof,<br />
          the rain did not get though the main front zip because there was a waterproof flap over the outside of the zip<br />
          (waterproof flaps between you and the zip are useless).<br />
          All that matters with waterproofs is all zips and seams need to be storm proof where the wind hits you,<br />
          the wind tries to force the water in.<br />
          The strongest wind will always hit you head on since the bikes moving forwards,<br />
          so you do not need storm proof zips behind you.<br />
          The only other place you need a good waterproof seal is between you and the seat,<br />
          you often end up with a puddle of water to sit in (make sure the seam is good).
        </p>
        <p>
          You can buy waterproof leather gloves but the leather still gets soaked, the waterproof part is underneath the leather.<br />
          You can buy waterproofs that go over your gloves, but you will find controlling the motorcycle more difficult.<br />
          The best way to get a waterproof seal is by fitting handlebar muffs<br />
          or maybe plastic hand guards (stops the wind forcing the water in), see <a href="riding_in_winter.htm#Hands">Hands</a> in <a href=
          "riding_in_winter.htm">Riding in Winter</a> page.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can buy waterproofs that go over shoes or boots,<br />
          some are for motorcycling and others for pedal cycling (even some for walking).<br />
          All that matters is the front of your foot is protected and a bit of the sides<br />
          (make sure you have enough grip to stop motorcycle falling over).
        </p>
        <p>
          Lined waterproof coats and trousers are better than unlined ones (not so hot, sticky and less condensation).
        </p>
        <h2>
          <a name="Water-Proofing-Waxes-Liquids-and-Sprays"></a>Water Proofing Waxes Liquids and Sprays
        </h2>
        <p>
          Even a 100% waterproof breathable coat, trousers, boots and gloves need re waterproofing from time to time.<br />
          That's because the waterproof breathable liner is on the inside of the item.
        </p>
        <p>
          The outside of the item is identical to a non water proof breathable item (e.g. textile or leather).
        </p>
        <p>
          If the outside of the item becomes soaked with water it becomes heavy,<br />
          cold (loses its insulation abilities) and stops the item from breathing.<br />
          A waterproof breathable liner actually loses its waterproof abilities and lets in water if it cannot breath,<br />
          (it will regain its waterproofing when it can breathe again).
        </p>
        <p>
          So the first line of defence for any item is to make the outside water resistant.<br />
          The best way to test its water resistance, is to put some water on it.<br />
          If the water soaks in to it, it needs treatment.<br />
          If the water forms drops on top of the item which do not soak in or prefer to drop off when the item is moved,<br />
          it does not need treatment yet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Water Proofing Waxes, Liquids and Sprays are used to make non water proof textile and leather items water resistant.<br />
          They are available in motorcycle shops as well as mountain / walking etc. shops.<br />
          They do wear off after time and usage, so have to be re applied.<br />
          If you have a water proof breathable liner, you need to make sure any wax, liquid or spray<br />
          you buy is designed to work with water proof breathable liners (it will say so on its label).
        </p>
        <p>
          You also need to make sure any wax, liquid or spray will keep your item breathable.<br />
          And make sure it is designed to work with your type of clothing, textile, leather, colour etc.<br />
          Nikwax is a very common brand name for instants and manufacture loads of different things<br />
          to make all sorts of items water resistant.
