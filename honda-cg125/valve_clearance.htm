          Honda CG125 Valve Clearance
        </h1>
        <p>
          <a class="back" href="servicing.htm">&lt; Servicing</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          New valves will change their clearances while they run in so check every 2500 miles,<br />
          when run in you will find they do not need adjusting so often, so check every 5000 miles.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's not recommended to ignore checking the valve clearance, but if you do,<br />
          listen (helmet off) to the valves at the top of the engine when it's running,<br />
          if they are excessively noisy (clatter, clatter) the clearance is too big and needs adjustment.<br />
          If one of the valves goes quiet its clearance is too small and must be adjusted immediately to prevent damage.<br />
          Performance drop, bad idling, problems starting or compression drop could mean the valve clearance is too big or small,<br />
          check immediately to prevent damage.<br />
          Valve clearances normally increase due to mechanical wear, but can sometimes decrease.<br />
          The Honda CG125 is a pushrod type so valve clearance could reduce (but may increase), as the engine warms up.<br />
          If the valve clearance is to big the only damage you are likely to have done is increased the wear rate of the valve.<br />
          Valves wear out (normally takes a very long time and high mileage) and can be replaced,<br />
          when the gap is too large they wear out far quicker.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Leave bike overnight to cool down, this is essential since the valve clearance changes with a hot engine.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img alt="" height="298" src="images/valve_holes.jpg" width="300" /><br />
          If you do not have the two covers in the picture above (you will have something more like <a href=
          "images/old_left_crankcase_cover.jpg">Picture</a>),<br />
          skip step 2 below and go straight to step 3.
        </p>
        <p class="hang-indent-1">
          2. If you really cannot do this step 2 then try step 4 instead.<br />
          Remove the two round covers (use 10 mm and 6 mm Allen keys, hex, 6 sided <a href="images/allen.jpg">Picture</a>)<br />
          on the left hand side of the engine case (see picture above).<br />
          (If they will not undo, warm the bike up and try again, once they are off leave the bike overnight to cool down again).<br />
          The 10 mm one covers the nut for turning over the engine.<br />
          The 6 mm one covers the marks for valve clearance and timing (T is for valve and F for timing).
        </p>
        <p class="indent-1">
          <img alt="" height="176" src="images/valve_hole_line_up.gif" width="165" /><br />
          Turn engine over anticlockwise with a 14 mm socket (<a href="images/socket.jpg">Picture</a>)<br />
          until a small on its side T appears near the outside edge of the disc (don't mistake F for T).<br />
          If you do not have a 14 mm socket<br />
          you can use rear wheel + 5th gear instead (wheel needs to be turning to change between gears)<br />
          (Never turn the rear wheel in the direction that would make the bike go backwards when the bikes in gear,<br />
          that would turn the engine over in reverse which it is not designed to do)<br />
          You can remove the spark plug to make turning over the engine easier but it's not really needed.
        </p>
        <p class="indent-1">
          Use a torch and magnifying glass since T is very small and stamped in to the metal,<br />
          do not use a house light bulb since it's too powerful and will hide it with glare.<br />
          The black outside edge in the drawing above could be curved away from you making it invisible under the wrong light<br />
          (grey area is not curved so will be visible).<br />
          Direct sunlight or strong daylight could also make it impossible to see<br />
          (take bike in to a building with low or no daylight or at least find as much shade as possible)
        </p>
        <p class="indent-1">
          Line the mark (vertical line) below (maybe next to) the T up with the grove at the top of the hole<br />
          (only turn anticlockwise since engines don't like going in reverse)<br />
          (if your eyesight is to bad ask someone else).
        </p>
        <p class="hang-indent-1">
          3. Skip all of this step 3 (go to step 4) if you were able to do step 2.<br />
          If you really cannot do this step 3 then try step 4 instead.<br />
          Remove the <a href="general.htm#Gear-change-lever">gear change lever</a><br />
          Remove the left hand crankcase cover <a href="images/old_left_crankcase_cover.jpg">Picture</a> (needs an 8 mm long and thin socket).<br />
          (if the nuts will not undo, warm the bike up and try again, once they are off leave bike overnight to cool down again)<br />
          (if the engine cover does not come off after removing all the nuts, tap the cover to break the seal).<br />
          If the covers gasket does not come off in one piece (due to old age) you will have to replace it<br />
          (you can smear a very small amount of light grease around it to help next time).<br />
          If the nuts and threads are suffering from corrosion you can use grease (even better is copper grease)<br />
          to stop them getting any worse.

        <p>
          Vertical line next to the T
        </p>
        <p class="under-img">
          Find the mark at around 12 to 1 o'clock,<br />
          Turn the engine over anti clockwise with a 17 mm socket (<a href="images/socket.jpg">Picture</a>),<br />
          you may be able to use a spanner or your hand (by hand requires the spark plug removed).<br />
          Line the vertical line next to the T with the mark (don't mistake F for T).
        </p>
        <p class="hang-indent-1">
          4. Skip all of this step 4 if you managed step 2 or 3.<br />
          This step is not as good as step 2 or 3 so only do this step as a last resort.<br />
          You need to get the piston to the highest point in the engine; this is called Top Dead Centre (TDC).
        </p>
        <p class="indent-1">
          Never turn the rear wheel in the direction that would make the bike go backwards when the bikes in gear,<br />
          that would turn the engine over in reverse.<br />
          Put the bike in to 5th gear (the back wheel needs to be turning to change between gears).<br />
          Remove the spark plug and put something like a thin screw driver down the spark plug hole.<br />
          Turn the back wheel and watch the piston move up and down<br />
          (make sure that whatever you put in the hole does not get trapped or damage anything or fall in to the engine).<br />
          When the piston moves upwards it will push whatever you put in the hole upwards,<br />
          after the piston reaches Top Dead Centre (TDC) it will go downwards.<br />
          It's essential to get the piston to the highest point in the engine to get the correct valve clearance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ignore all of Step 5 if you have the front drum brake model.<br />
          5. <a href="valve_clearance_step_5.htm">Valve Clearance Step 5</a>

          <img alt="" height="330" src="images/valve_cover_right.jpg" width="400" />
        </p>
        <p class="hang-indent-1">
          6. Remove the valve cover, it's on the very top of the engine, two bolts on the right hand side and one on the left (10mm),<br />
          there's a rubber gasket inside a grove that's inside the lid<br />
          (do not lose or damage / trap it, if you drop it in dirt clean it then soak it in engine oil).<br />
          You will find there is a technique to getting the valve cover off;<br />
          it gets caught on the bikes metal frame and also the valves inside.<br />
          You may think it's impossible to get out, but there is a way,<br />
          keep trying all the different angles till you find the technique, brute force does not work.<br />
          Front Disc Brake model, go to the right hand side of bike, lift valve cover up and tilt it forwards slightly, tilt cover towards you.
        </p>
        <p class="hang-indent-1">
          7. Check that you can rock the valves, if you cannot;<br />
          you are on the wrong engine stroke, simply repeat step 2 or 3 (whichever one you did).<br />
          If you cannot work out if the valves are rocking, they will only rock if there's some valve clearance.<br />
          If you're on the wrong stroke there's no valve clearance (see picture below).

        <p class="hang-indent-1">
          8. The valve clearance should be set to 0.08mm (0.003 in) on both valves,<br />
          this applies to all Honda CG125 models, there are only 2 valves.
        </p>
        <p class="indent-1">
          A Feeler Gauge (<a href="images/f_gauge.jpg">Picture</a>) is available from most car motor shops;<br />
          a feeler gauge is just a set of metal plates of various thicknesses.
        </p>
        <p class="indent-1">
          The valve clearance is the gap between the round metal rods (it's easy to assume it's a single rod since the gap is so small).<br />
          If the valve clearance is correct, you will feel very slight resistance from the feeler gauge when moving it through the gap.<br />
          If you find the valves need to be adjusted,<br />
          it's worth trying to turn the engine over several times (repeat step 2 or 3 twice then check and repeat)<br />
          to see if it is then correct, there's always a slight variation every time you turn the engine over.<br />
          To adjust a valve, loosen the nut (10mm) on the valve you wish to adjust,<br />
          use pliers (or hand) to turn the top of the screw thread (or obtain the proper tool)<br />
          until the clearance is at the correct amount, then re tighten the nut.<br />
          Recheck the valve clearance after re tightening the nut, if it has gone out, loosen the nut again and readjust.<br />
          If the valve clearance changes every time you tighten the nut, you may have to hold the screw when tightening the nut<br />
          or set the clearance slightly wrong so when the nut is tightened the clearance becomes correct.
        </p>
        <p class="hang-indent-1">
          9. Reassemble everything in reverse order, but make sure the rubber air hose is not trapped on the inside when<br />
          attaching the air box to the valve cover (does not apply to the front drum brake model since it does not have one).
