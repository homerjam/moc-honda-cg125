        <h1>
          Honda CG125 Bike Damage after an Accident
        </h1>
        <p>
          <a class="back" href="basic_fault_finding.htm">&lt; Faults</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Also read all of the following if you have bought a 2nd hand Honda CG125<br />
          since they are often used by many learners and learners often drop bikes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Check all the lights work including all 4 indicators and the brake light<br />
          (tap each light with your finger to make sure there are no loose connections).
        </p>
        <p>
          If you drop the bike, the normal damage is to the foot rest.<br />
          The foot rests are bolted to the metal bar that attaches to the underside of the engine.<br />
          When the bike falls over, all the weight of the bike goes on the foot rest, both wheels leave the ground.<br />
          The handlebar end also makes contact with the ground, there's not much weight on it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The foot rest will often bend out of position.<br />
          You can fix this by using a large heavy hammer and bash it back to position; quick strikes are more effective than slow ones.<br />
          To work out when the foot rest is in the correct position, walk a decent distance away from the front of the bike,<br />
          kneel down and look straight at the bike, see if the foot rests on both sides are the same height and pointing the same.<br />
          Also look straight down at the foot rest to see if it's bent forwards or backwards.<br />
          If you cannot bend it back to position, you will have to order a new metal bar and foot rest.<br />
          It simply bolts to the underside of the engine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other things to check is the gear shift lever, make sure it's not bent, if it is bend it back to shape,<br />
          it can be easily replaced (see <a href="general.htm#Gear-change-lever">Gear change lever</a> in <a href="general.htm">General</a>
          page).<br />
          Make sure nut bolt is tight; it can come slightly loose in an accident.
        </p>
        <p>
          Look for oil leaks from the engine (also look for oil on the ground) and the front forks, several times over the next few days.<br />
          Check the oil level; see <a href="oil.htm#How-to-check-the-Oil-level">How to check the Oil level</a> in the <a href=
          "oil.htm">Engine Oil</a> page.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can check the following, but a MOT (if you live in the UK) should check them.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you fell off to the right, also check the rear brake pedal and silencer (bend back to position if necessary).
        </p>
        <p>
          The next thing to check is if you have bent the front forks.<br />
          If you have, the handlebars will not point straight ahead when you are travelling straight.<br />
          So the front wheel points one way and the handlebars another.<br />
          If you have this problem you probably have not bent the front forks (unless the impact was very hard)<br />
          but have knocked them out of alignment.<br />
          The forks are what attach the handle bars to the front wheel<br />
          (one fork connects to the left hand side of the wheel, the other to the right),<br />
          at the top of each fork are some nuts that can be loosened and then you can re align the handlebars to the wheel<br />
          (put weight on passenger seat to lift front wheel off ground).
        </p>
        <p>
          To check the handlebars are not bent,<br />
          simple walk a decent distance away from the front of the bike and look at the bars pointing straight ahead,<br />
          also look at the brake and clutch lever.
        </p>
        <p>
          The final thing to check is if you have bent the chassis. This requires you to check the wheel alignment.<br />
          There are several different ways.<br />
          But the idea is for one person to sit on the bike and keep the bike level and the handlebars dead straight.<br />
          Another person puts a straight edge like a metal ladder either side of the bike. They then push it parallel against the back wheel.<br />
          They then look at the small gap between the straight edge and the front wheel;<br />
          the gap should be the same amount on both sides of the wheel.<br />
          If you have not got a straight edge long enough, there is another harder way, search the internet for the other technique.<br />
          Remember the wheel alignment will change if the rear wheel chain adjuster nuts are adjusted incorrectly<br />
          (if you adjust one side more than the other), see <a href="chain.htm">Chain</a> page.
