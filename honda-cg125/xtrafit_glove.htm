          GORE-TEX X-TRAFIT Motorcycle Glove Review
        </h1>
        <p>
          This review is not about a particular brand or model of Glove,<br />
          instead it will show you what a difference a GORE-TEX X-TRAFIT lined glove makes to motorcycling.
        </p>
        <p>
          The review below was written in 2009, when the glove cost £69.99 (normal price, not a sale).<br />
          After a while the price went up to £89.99 and so the review was updated.<br />
		  All Hein Gericke stores in the UK were closed down or sold to their competitors in 2012 and 2013.<br />
		  The Hein Gericke brand (a German company) was purchased by a Chinese company in late 2013 or early 2014.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img alt="" height="310" src="images/x_trafit_glove.jpg" style="float: left" width="300" />
        </p>
        <p>
          Hein Gericke X-TRAFIT Leather GORE-TEX Glove.<br />
          The glove uses the latest technology to bond the famous GORE-TEX<br />
          (waterproof, breathable and windproof) fabric used in outdoor clothing<br />
          (mountain, skiing etc.) with a skin friendly fabric to a Motorcycle glove.
        </p>
        <p>
          This special bonding (X-Trafit) technique<br />
          makes all 3 layers feel like they are a single layer. So you have no slipping<br />
          and sliding between the layers like a normal multilayer (lined) glove.<br />
          This substantially improves feel and control of the motorcycle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before this bonding technology existed you had to decide<br />
          if you wanted the feel and control of an unlined glove<br />
          or the waterproof and warmth of a lined glove<br />
          (with far less feel and control of the motorcycle).
        </p>
        <p>
          The quality of the leather, stitching and stretchable leather<br />
          (on back of hand and fingers)<br />
          + visor wipe on left thumb makes this a very high quality glove.
        </p>
        <p class="under-img">
          The glove is very highly priced at £89.99 a pair but as you will see in the rest of this review,<br />
          it is well worth the extra money for every type of rider and bike on the road.<br />
          For information about cheaper gloves, see <a href="motorcycle_clothing.htm#Gloves">Gloves</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          I have used this glove for over 1 year now and well over 5,000 miles,<br />
          there is no sign of ageing or wear and tear so I expect a very long life out of it.<br />
          It has been used on all types of road including motorways, city centre grid lock,<br />
          tight twisty back roads and over 200 mile rides in a day.
        </p>
        <p>
          The glove does not have the feel and control of a high quality unlined glove,<br />
          but it is far closer to an unlined glove than a lined one (not bonded).<br />
          The GORE-TEX liner works incredibly well to block the wind and yet breathes very well.<br />
          I found it amazing how it can block the cold wind, but when it's hot the breathability means your hands do not get hot or sweaty.<br />
          It really is a miracle fabric and for UK motorcyclists hands an absolute essential piece of equipment (due to our weather).
        </p>
        <p>
          In the rain the special bonding (X-Trafit) of the GORE-TEX liner to the leather<br />
          means that water cannot soak through and collect between it and the liner.<br />
          This results in a glove that does not get soaking wet and heavy like a normal waterproof or non-waterproof glove.<br />
          It also has a visor wipe and of course is waterproof and breathable.
        </p>
        <p>
          The rest of the glove has also been very good.<br />
          The quality of the leather, stretchable leather on back of hand and fingers have all made the glove a real joy to use.<br />
          As well as it's light weight and reduced vibration from the bike (compared to an unlined glove).
        </p>
        <p>
          The breathability of this glove is very, very good for a lined glove, this is due to not only being GORE-TEX,<br />
          but also that there is no air gap between the liner and the glove, as well as the holes in the leather on the sides of the fingers.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the middle of the hottest days in summer when the humidity was at its worst (in the UK), the gloves were very comfortable.<br />
          So comfortable there was no advantage in riding the bike with no gloves on.<br />
          A couple of times near the end of a long ride I did take them off and ride the bike,<br />
          I found it only very slightly better without (so slight it was not worth the added danger).
        </p>
        <p>
          While many other motorcyclists I saw had to resort to using no gloves (very bad if you fall off or are hit by anything).<br />
          In the past I had high quality unlined gloves and in those conditions<br />
          also had to take them off due to the wool insulation on the back of the fingers = hot and sweaty.
        </p>
        <p>
          The only times I had trouble in those conditions is if my hands were already hot and sweaty and I put the gloves on,<br />
          rode the bike for 3 miles in the city traffic and then tried to take them off.<br />
          Since the gloves had not had enough time to dry my hands, they were a bit hard to get off.<br />
          But as soon as you had done a few more miles<br />
          and had a bit more air flowing (due to bikes speed) they were dry and comfortable.<br />
          This is due to the glove being able to remove the moisture from your hands and get it out of the glove.<br />
          It really is weird taking the gloves off and finding your hands 100% dry with no moisture (sweat).
        </p>
        <p>
          So these gloves are not hot and sweaty in the hottest and highest humidity in the UK summer.<br />
          So you would assume there is a load of air getting through the glove and hitting your hands.<br />
          Well there is not, the GORE-TEX stops the wind getting through.<br />
          This means when you have a cold wind hitting the glove, your hands do not receive the cold air.<br />
          GORE-TEX really is a miracle material.<br />
          I think the correct word for all this is climate control.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course there always has to be some disadvantage to all of this.<br />
          Well the problem is when summer is over and it starts to get really cold<br />
          (7 Celsius, no sun, 50 mile ride with a strong head wind was real trouble after 25 miles).<br />
          The glove does stop the cold wind getting though the glove,<br />
          but cannot stop the outside of the glove getting colder and colder due to wind chill.<br />
          The glove has no insulation, not even air between the layers (due to X-Trafit), so the cold seeps through over time and distance.<br />
          If the glove did have insulation or air between the layers it would be like other gloves,<br />
          too hot in summer or harder to control the bike.<br />
          But I have found a glove perfect to take over when it gets this cold and is also the best glove in the coldest of the UK winter,<br />
