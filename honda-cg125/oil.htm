        </h2>
        <p>
          Choosing the right oil is not only essential for the protection of any motorcycle engine,<br />
          but also to reduce wear, improve engine, clutch, gearbox and to clean.<br />
          This article will show you the differences between oil types, my reviews of the main types and disproves many of the oil myths.<br />
          As well as what real semi synthetic and real fully synthetic oil is and why not to always believe the claims on the oil bottles label.
        </p>
        <p>
          I highly recommend you at least use real semi synthetic oil in any size of 4 stroke motorcycle engine<br />
          (2 stroke engines have nearly disappeared).<br />
          Since motorcycles from around the year 2000 onwards have gradually had stricter and stricter emission laws,<br />
          resulting in the engines running leaner and leaner and other problems (which generates more and more heat and other things).<br />
          As a result the oil quality has become far more critical (even in liquid cooled engines).
        </p>
        <p>
          The above paragraph especially includes 125cc engines in my opinion.<br />
          Since 125cc average engine revs (rpm) are very high, small quantity of oil in engine and many other things.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would only use motorcycle oil; car oil may work but might cause trouble in the long term.<br />
          There are so many technical reasons why not to use car oil,<br />
          the main ones are cars do not use the engine oil in the clutch or gearbox.<br />
          Engine oil was never meant to be used in gearboxes, but in motorcycles it nearly always is (unlike cars),<br />
          this means the oil has a much harder job and life<br />
          (so motorcycle oil has extra things in it to protect the gearbox and increase the oil life).
        </p>
        <p>
          The best car oil also has anti friction chemicals in that will probably result in the clutch slipping (that is bad) on a motorcycle,<br />
          that's because cars do not use the engine oil to lubricate the clutch unlike nearly all motorcycles.<br />
          The best car oil is fully synthetic,<br />
          using this oil in motorcycles is what probably started the using motorcycle fully synthetic oil will cause clutch slip myth.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would not use a very cheap or unknown brand of motorcycle oil,<br />
          since it could clog up the filters and or even damage the engine.<br />
          <img alt="" height="440" src="images/silkolene_comp4.jpg" style="float: left" width="320" />
        </p>
        <p class="down-100px">
          Since the free 600 miles service I used real semi synthetic oil<br />
          (Silkolene Comp 4 10W-40).<br />
          I was running in the engine,<br />
          so I do not know what it did to the performance, but the clutch felt a lot smoother.
        </p>
        <p>
          Real semi synthetic has Ester in it which will protect the engine when cold<br />
          and also at high revs, it will also not break down as fast at high engine revs,<br />
          so the oil will do more miles before needing to be replaced<br />
          (I would still change it early anyway), unlike mineral oil / fake semi synthetic oil.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many oils claim to be semi synthetic but are in fact normal mineral oil.<br />
          If it has Ester on the label you know it is real semi synthetic or real fully synthetic,<br />
          Silkolene and Motul both state on their bottles label if Ester is in the oil.
        </p>
        <p class="under-img">
          <a name="Silkolene-Pro-4-Plus"></a> <img alt="" height="440" src="images/silkolene_pro4plus.jpg" style="float: left" width="320" />
        </p>
        <p class="down-100px">
          I now use Silkolene Pro 4 Plus 5W-40 Fully Synthetic oil<br />
          (after using Silkolene Comp 4 for a long time).<br />
          The 5W means the oil will be thinner when engine is cold<br />
          (so engine will be better protected and lubricated).
        </p>
        <p>
          The engine has around 1/3 less vibration at the top of the rev range<br />
          (this is really good for engine and rider).<br />
          The clutch is much better, overheating and varying far less<br />
          (especially around town racing between the lights)<br />
          and has better traction (friction).<br />
          Gearbox is also changing much better<br />
          (this will be linked to the clutch since it's not overheating so much),<br />
          it even clunks far less severely when you change down at to higher road speed.<br />
          Engine is much quieter and might be revving slightly more freely as well.
        </p>
        <p class="under-img">
          All the above happened the first time I put Silkolene Pro 4 Plus oil in to the bike,<br />
          My motorcycles oil changes normally leave 20% of the old oil in the bike, so I was not running 100% new oil.<br />
          When it was time to change the oil, I tried to warm the engine up far more than with the Silkolene Comp 4 oil.<br />
          I did 50 miles at high engine revs with a 30 min rest at half distance.<br />
          To my amazement the oil drain nut and the oil was substantially cooler than with the Silkolene Comp 4 oil.<br />
          There is a slight chance this was due to a strong cold wind, but I do not think so.<br />
          I think it's much cooler because it's lubricating and cooling the engine better (explains the other improvements).
        </p>
        <p>
          The oil change also brought out a layer of very thick black oil and a little metal (very little) from the engine.<br />
          This is a really good thing, it means the oil is doing a better job of picking up the thick black oil and metal<br />
          that builds up at the bottom of the engine and gets it out of the engine.<br />
          After the oil change everything improved again since there is a higher % of Silkolene Pro 4 Plus in the engine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another good thing about Silkolene Pro 4 Plus is it's amber in colour (light yellow),<br />
          this means it's easier to see it darken (on the dip stick) as it gets dirtier in the engine due to burning deposits etc.<br />
          Silkolene Comp 4 is brown so it's harder to see the change.
        </p>
        <p>
          3rd Oil Change with Silkolene Pro 4 Plus (removing the Pro 4 plus for the 2nd time from engine).<br />
          I tried to warm engine up with a 100 mile ride at high revs with a 1 hour stop at half distance,<br />
          the oil nut was about as cool as last time (50 mile ride).<br />
          There was no thick black oil this time, just a very small amount of black oil at the bottom<br />
          (so the previous oil change really did a large amount of cleaning).<br />
          Looking at the oil I did get out, it was still a bit dark for my liking,<br />
          so I expect it's still cleaning the engine out, so next time I expect it to be lighter.
        </p>
        <p>
          4th Oil Change, the oil I got out this time was cleaner (lighter) than the 3rd Oil Change but not massively better.
        </p>
        <p>
          5th Oil Change, checked the clutch plates and centrifugal oil filter to disprove the myth about fully synthetic oil (see below);<br />
          both were perfect and did not need to be checked according to a very experienced mechanic.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the results above, I believe my engine,<br />
          clutch and gearbox are being much better protected (less wear) with the Silkolene Pro 4 Plus oil,<br />
          so I highly recommend you try it (I will only use Silkolene Pro 4 Plus in my engine due to the results).<br />
          Especially if your bike spends a lot of time at high engine revs or a lot of short journeys<br />
          (since it's thinner when cold = better lubrication = less engine wear).
        </p>
        <p>
          The bike used is a Honda CG125,<br />
          Air Cooled Push Rod engine (very primitive 4 stroke engine), with Euro II emission laws (2004 to 2008).<br />
          So if a very primitive engine design likes the very best oil,<br />
          which most people thought you only need for high end sports bikes, you can probably work out it's worth trying in your engine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Silkolene Comp 4 (real semi synthetic) as proved above, is not as good as Silkolene Pro 4 Plus (real fully synthetic),<br />
          but it's cheaper and gives you much better protection than oils that claim to be semi synthetic<br />
          (when there not, see later on below for full explanation).<br />
          My advice is it really is worth trying Silkolene Pro 4 Plus, it may be more expensive but you get far more for your money,<br />
          in the unlikely event you do not find the improvements in your engine, gearbox and clutch worth the extra money,<br />
          just go down to Silkolene Comp 4.
        </p>
        <p>
          Common myths about fully synthetic motorcycle oil, that many mechanics and shops still believe.<br />
          These myths have been around for many, many years, if confronted with have you actually experienced it or where is the proof,<br />
          all the mechanics / shops I have ever spoken to have no answer,<br />
          they often claim it makes sense for some reason or other or they heard or read about it.<br />
          To find out if these myths are true you need a motorcycle oil scientist who works,<br />
          designs and tests the oils on motorcycles (I managed to speak to one).
        </p>
        <p>
          Motorcycle fully synthetic oil clutch slip myth has been proved to be wrong earlier on in this article<br />
          (car oil fully synthetic was probably used to create slip),<br />
          I have also proved it with my own tests, in fact Pro 4 Plus has less slip than non fully synthetic oil,<br />
          since Silkolene have admitted to putting a special additive in it,<br />
          after using the oil for many thousands of miles on the old original clutch plates (checking them after and finding them perfect)<br />
          and then many thousands of miles on new EBC clutch plates, I have absolutely no concerns with the oil.<br />
          The motorcycle oil scientist also confirms that motorcycle fully synthetic oil does not cause clutch slip, it's designed not to.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next myth, you should not go to fully synthetic motorcycle oil and then down to semi synthetic or mineral oil or vice a versa<br />
          since it might cause trouble.<br />
          And you should not mix semi synthetic with fully synthetic or mineral oil<br />
          (when you change engine oil you never get all the old oil out).<br />
          All I can say about these myths is the logic behind them varies and every reason I have heard makes no scientific sense.<br />
          The motorcycle oil scientist also confirms the myths are wrong.<br />
          He even claims that mixing different brands of oil is probably ok (cannot be guaranteed but should be ok).
        </p>
        <p>
          Below is a full explanation about what is real semi synthetic or real fully synthetic oil and why you would want it,<br />
          as well as why a bottle of oil may claim to be semi synthetic or fully synthetic when it's not.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mineral oil comes out of the ground.<br />
          Synthetic is supposed to be 100% man made.<br />
          One company messed around with mineral oil and claimed that since a person messed about with it,<br />
          it was now semi synthetic, there was a legal case and they won.<br />
          All they did to the mineral oil was molecularly convert it.<br />
          With that logic you could milk a cow and boil the milk and claim it's now semi synthetic.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two 100% man made products and they are real synthetics, since they are nothing to do with mineral oil.<br />
          One is Ester, this is what protects your engine when cold and also at high revs.<br />
          The other synthetic product is PAO<br />
          Ester clings to the parts in the engine and lubricates them,<br />
          Mineral oil does not cling as well when the engine is cold, this results in a lack of oil lubricating the engine,<br />
          which is why most engine wear happens when the engine is cold.<br />
          Mineral oil also loses its viscosity (thickness) at high temperatures,<br />
          so at high engine revs, the oil thins and loses its lubrication abilities,<br />
          mineral oil also breaks down at high temperatures so must be replaced more often.<br />
          Ester must be mixed with PAO or Mineral oil; else your engine would smash itself to pieces.<br />
          PAO when mixed with Ester results in the ultimate oil (better than Mineral oil with Ester in it),<br />
          but PAO on its own is worse than mineral oil on its own.<br />
          Real Fully Synthetic oil should have Ester and PAO in it with no Mineral Oil (or any form of converted mineral oil).<br />
          Real Semi Synthetic oil should have Ester with some form of Mineral Oil in it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have tried to find as many brands and models of motorcycle oil as I can in the UK and work out what's in it.<br />
          Finding out what's in the oil has proved to be impossible in nearly every make.<br />
          Even when it says fully synthetic it could be 100% messed about with mineral oil<br />
          (which may give less protection than normal mineral oil).<br />
          Or could be 100% PAO with no Ester in it.<br />
          Semi Synthetic as mentioned before also means nothing.<br />
          There are loads of names that oil companies have invented to make their oil sound like it's better than others,<br />
          that actually mean nothing. PAO, Ester and Mineral oil are the only names that mean anything, they are scientific facts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ester costs a lot more to manufacture than PAO, so some oil companies are tempted to make a PAO only oil with no Ester in it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The only makes of motorcycle oil I could find in the UK,<br />
          that states on the bottles label if Ester is in their oil is Silkolene and Motul.<br />
          I believe Silkolene Pro 4 Plus is PAO and Ester with no form of Mineral oil in it.<br />
          I expect Motul 300V is the same.<br />
          I believe Silkolene Comp 4 is Mineral oil and Ester.
        </p>
        <p>
          I personally would not trust any make that does not state if Ester is in the oil.<br />
          Even if the manufacturer has a reputation for being very high quality and expensive,<br />
          you are relying on trust and they can easily re label someone else's product.
        </p>
        <h2>
          <a name="When-to-change-the-Oil"></a>When to change the Oil
        </h2>
        <p>
          The best advice is to treat the mileage in the Owner's Manual as an absolute maximum.
        </p>
        <p>
          The quality of the oil, your riding style and the state of the engine will all affect how long the oil will protect the engine.<br />
          When the oil degrades the oil may be burned and you will notice the oil level drop on the dip stick<br />
          (see <a href="#How-to-check-the-Oil-level">How to check the Oil level</a> below).<br />
          Running below the min mark often results in the engine seizing,<br />
          the repair bill is normally so high, the engine has to be replaced with a new or 2nd hand one<br />
          (replacement engines are very expensive).<br />
          The other reason for burning oil is the engine is faulty or a part is worn out.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example my Honda CG125 (front disc brake model) owner's manual says change the oil every 2500 miles.<br />
          After 1750 miles my bikes oil is still at maximum on the dip stick, but at 1950 miles it has dropped to half way.<br />
          So I should change the oil at 1750 miles or before,<br />
          if I was desperate I could instead,<br />
          top up the oil to the max mark (but would have to do this very regularly since oil has degraded and is being burned).<br />
          Please note the mileage your oil will last will be different to mine,<br />
          since your riding style, quality of oil and state of the engine will be different.<br />
          I know one person who put low quality oil in his near identical to mine,<br />
          perfect engine and he starts burning oil at around 750 miles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just because no oil has been burned does not mean it's not in need of being changed,<br />
          the oil can lose its protection abilities and not be burned.<br />
          For instance you might be able to go way over the recommended oil change mileage and not burn any oil,<br />
          but the oil and filters become very dirty.<br />
          As oil becomes dirtier it will turn darker and darker until it eventually turns black<br />
          (which is bad and bungs up filters, Honda CG125 see <a href="#Centrifugal-Oil-filter">Centrifugal Oil filter</a>),<br />
          even the oil on the dipstick will darken, see <a href="#How-to-check-the-Oil-level">How to check the Oil level</a> section below.
        </p>
        <p>
          Short journeys are bad for oil, the engine does not get up to heat and condensation occurs,<br />
          this means the oil will become dirtier per mile than on normal journeys, so you need to change the oil at less mileage.

          It's probably a good idea to change the oil every year (maybe every 6 months), even if you have not done enough miles.
        </p>
        <p>
          I highly recommend you read the <a href="#Which-Oil-quality-to-use">Which Oil quality to use</a> section above to find what Oil
          quality you should use.

          Remove dip stick<br />
          (big plastic knob, right hand side of bike, it measures the oil in the engine),<br />
          wipe the oil off,<br />
          put dip stick back in bike but do not screw it in,<br />
          the xxxx marks at the bottom of the dip stick should face sideways (not up and down),<br />
          take dip stick out of bike and look were the oil has gone up to on the dip stick,<br />
          the xxxx marks on the bottom of the dip stick mark the min and max mark.<br />
          In the picture 2 is the maximum mark, 3 is the minimum mark.
        </p>
        <p class="under-img">
          It's much easier to see the oil in natural daylight than with a light bulb.<br />
          There's no harm going slightly above the max mark, but not excessively,<br />
          never run the engine below the min mark (may damage or destroy engine).<br />
          Make sure you check the oil level with the bike on level ground.<br />
          There is an argument whether you should check the oil level with a cold or warm engine,<br />
          with a warm engine make sure the engine is switched off for 5 minutes first.

          See <a href="#When-to-change-the-Oil">When to change the Oil</a> section above to find out why it is so important to check the Oil
          level regularly.

        </h2>
        <p>
          Honda CG125 only.<br />
          Tools Required.<br />
          24 mm Spanner or Socket to undo oil drain nut (left hand side of bike near the bottom).<br />
          Front Drum Brake model may (depends on version) have another oil drain nut under the bike,<br />
          needs a 17 mm spanner or socket.<br />
          Container to collect old oil (2 litre ice cream container or anything).<br />
          Rubber gloves to protect hands from oil.<br />
          Small funnel to help pour new oil in to bike<br />
          (washing up liquid bottle, water bottle, pop or squash bottle cut in half and 100% cleaned and dry).
        </p>
        <p>
          Warm up engine for at least 3 minutes (idling and revving).<br />
          You will get more oil out if you take the bike for a long fast ride to get the oil as hot as possible,<br />
          the more oil you get out the better.<br />
          I have found 5 miles at 40 mph in 5th gear (nut not to hot) does not get as much oil out<br />
          as 17 miles with over half of that over 50 mph in 5th gear (nut very hot).<br />
          Even with gloves on the nut is too hot to touch on the 17 mile trip,<br />
          you end up dropping the nut unless you hold it with many layers of cloth or towel to insulate it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Switch off engine and immediately
        </p>
        <p>
          Put container under the bike to catch the oil<br />
          Put rubber gloves on hands<br />
          Remove the dip stick (big plastic knob, right hand side of bike, it measures the oil in the engine).
        </p>
        <p>
          The Front Drum Brake model may (depends on version, often it's only on very old bikes)<br />
          have a drain nut underneath the bike (17 mm);<br />
          this should be used to drain the oil (not the oil filter / drain nut in the paragraph below).
        </p>
        <p>
          Remove the drain nut (see picture below, if the gear change lever is in the way see <a href="general.htm#Gear-change-lever">Gear change
          lever</a> in <a href="general.htm">General</a> page).<br />
          If the nut is too tight you will have to tap / hit the spanner or socket handle with a hammer or something quickly several times.<br />
          You remove the nut like any normal nut, anti-clockwise to remove and clockwise to tighten.<br />
          If you use a spanner and it keeps slipping off the nut, try pushing it on to the nut while turning it,<br />
          if that fails try a better quality spanner.<br />
          A socket will grip the nut far better than any spanner<br />
          (the socket will probably need a 1/2 inch ratchet not the normal one that's smaller),<br />
          you can also increase the leverage on the socket handle (ratchet)<br />
          by extending it with standard 22mm plumbing copper pipe from most DIY stores.<br />

        </p>
        <p class="down-70px">
          The drain nut (24 mm, left hand side of bike near the bottom)<br />
          has a large spring &amp; oil filter sitting behind it.<br />
          Use the spring to wiggle the filter out.
        </p>
        <p class="under-img">
          <img alt="" height="92" src="images/oil_filter.jpg" style="float: left" width="300" />
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; The filter is made of metal with hundreds of very small holes in it.<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp; At one end it's round with about a 2.54 cm diameter, it's about 2.54 cm long.<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp; The spring is round and about 2.54 cm diameter,<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp; it's about 5.1cm long but only has around two 360 degree turns in it,<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp; the spring is not compressed much.
        </p>
        <p class="under-img">
          Clean filter with a suitable liquid like petrol (don't leave in petrol to long or it will eat the rubber).<br />
          If you clean the filter with petrol, the petrol will evaporate very quickly in the open air.
        </p>
        <p>
          The front disc brake model claims you only need to clean the oil filter every 7500 miles,<br />
          I would clean it more often, to stop the centrifugal oil filter having to clean the oil.<br />
          If you find anything major in the filter, look and think, if you're worried show it to a mechanic,<br />
          it's normal to get a bit of metal in there when an engine is running in.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Owner's Manual for the front disc brake model claims the centrifugal filter should be cleaned every 7500 miles.<br />
          The centrifugal oil filter is inside the engine and never needs to be cleaned<br />
          if you keep the other oil filter clean and change the oil on time<br />
          or before, according to the mechanics. For more details see <a href="#Centrifugal-Oil-filter">Centrifugal Oil filter</a> below.
        </p>
        <p>
          The oil will continue to drip out of the bike for ages, rocking the bike on the centre stand might help get more oil out,<br />
          also leaning the bike to the left slightly.<br />
          When it has stopped dripping, or you cannot wait any longer,<br />
          put the filter back in, then the spring and finally the drain nut back on.<br />
          Make sure the nut still has a black rubber O ring on it or it's in the screw hole,<br />
          if not find it, you may have dropped it in the oil container when you removed the nut.<br />
          If you use a socket to tighten the nut, do not over tighten it, especially if you have a long handle,<br />
          the nut is soft aluminium and it's tighter when you try to undo it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pour 900ml (1 litre bottles often have marks down the side) of 10W/40 new engine oil (see <a href="#Which-Oil-quality-to-use">Which
          Oil quality to use</a> above) in,<br />
          Check the oil level is at the max mark or above (see <a href="#How-to-check-the-Oil-level">How to check the Oil level</a>
          above),<br />
          if it's below the max mark put more oil in until it's at the max mark.<br />
          Warm engine up (screw dip stick back in first) for 3 minutes (idling and revving slightly in neutral)<br />
          and check oil level after it has been off for 5 minutes.<br />
          If the oil level has dropped below the max mark put more oil in until it reaches the max mark.

          The centrifugal oil filter should not need to be touched<br />
          as long as the engine oil has been changed at the correct mileage or before (see <a href="#How-to-change-the-Oil">Oil change</a>
          above).<br />
          But some people change the oil every 5000 miles or never,<br />
          this means the oil becomes very dirty, the filters then become clogged up and need to be cleaned.<br />
          When the oil gets dirty you will notice the colour change<br />
          (goes darker and darker until it goes black when very dirty) and other things,<br />
          if you change the oil at the correct mileage or before (see <a href="#How-to-change-the-Oil">Oil change</a> above),<br />
          the oil you drain out should be similar or identical in colour to the new oil.<br />
          Different brands and models of oil can have different colours;<br />
          the colour will look lighter when you pour it compared to looking at it in a container.<br />
          For example the new oil may look light brown as you pour it but look black when it's in a container.<br />
          Most if not all mechanics never clean the Centrifugal Oil filter, including the Honda ones,<br />
          unless it has clogged up due to lack of oil changes.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have neglected the oil changes and the oil has turned very dark or black,<br />
          you may be able to clean things without doing anything except,<br />
          change the oil far more frequently than normal until the oil you take out is much cleaner,<br />
          you can also use an oil with more powerful cleaning abilities<br />
          (see <a href="#Silkolene-Pro-4-Plus">Silkolene Pro 4 Plus</a> review in the <a href="#Which-Oil-quality-to-use">Which Oil
          quality to use</a> section above).
        </p>
        <p>
          But the methods above will only work if things are not too bad and may or may not clean things enough.<br />
          Even if you or a mechanic cleans the centrifugal filter as mentioned below,<br />
          I still advise you do the things in the paragraph above to clean everything as much as possible,<br />
          ideally do them before and after cleaning the centrifugal filter.
        </p>
        <p>
          My bikes oil changes are never neglected, at 25,000 miles the Centrifugal filter was checked and there was so little in it,<br />
          it's hardly worth mentioning.<br />
          A mechanic told me he has seen one which was full of metal debris,<br />
          from the clutch exploding due to deliberate, very, extreme abuse (probably repeated).
        </p>
        <p>
          The Owner's Manual for the front disc brake model claims the Centrifugal Oil filter should be cleaned every 7500 miles,<br />
          but the advice is to ignore it.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the Centrifugal Oil filter has to be cleaned, you will probably have to pay a mechanic.<br />
          Unless you are good mechanically or have a Haynes or other Honda CG125 workshop manual, do not try it yourself.<br />
          You need a special tool to remove it;<br />
          the specifications of the tool can be obtained and manufactured at most motorcycle servicing shops.<br />
          The tool required may depend on the model of Honda CG125.<br />
          The Haynes Workshop manual for the Honda CG125 should tell you and may even tell you how to make the tool yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          You also have to remove the oil, clutch cable, exhaust, foot rests including the metal bar they are on, brake pedal?<br />
          If you have a kick-start, you have to remove that as well.<br />
          Remove the right hand side engine cover, gasket (may need to buy a new one), oil filter cover.<br />
          You then have to stop the engine from turning (put bike in gear and apply rear brake).<br />
          Then you can unscrew and remove the filter.
