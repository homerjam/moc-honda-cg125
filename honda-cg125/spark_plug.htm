        <h2>
          Very important spark plug information, please read all of it even if you think you do not need to.
        </h2>
        <p>
          The older engines are meant to use NGK DR8ES-L for normal riding and have the gap set to 0.7mm<br />
          This appears to be for the old fashioned point's engines.<br />
          The chances are you do not need to check the gap when brand new, but I cannot guarantee this.
        </p>
        <p>
          The more modern engines, probably 1997 onwards in the UK have Electronic Ignition / CDI instead of points.<br />
          They are meant to have NGK DPR8EA-9 for normal riding and the gap set to 0.9mm.<br />
          The gap is pre-set at the factory to 0.9mm so it does not need to be checked when brand new,<br />
          that's what the -9 means at the end.
        </p>
        <p>
          A very experienced mechanic, who has owned many CG125 bikes over the years,<br />
          tells me you can use ether spark plug in ether engine.<br />
          He has done so and had no problems;<br />
          he said the main difference is the later one has a resistor to reduce air born interference, which does not affect the bike.
        </p>
        <p>
          NGK is the name of the manufacture and the rest is their part number.<br />
          Different spark plug manufacturers make equivalent spark plugs but have different part numbers.<br />
          The spark plug manufacturers do have conversion charts so you can convert from one make to another.
        </p>
        <p>
          NGK is regarded by most people as the best and Honda fit them as standard to the Honda CG125.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following information should be relevant to all Honda CG125 engines and owners.
        </p>
        <p>
          My Honda CG125 Front Disc Brake model uses the NGK DPR8EA-9
        </p>
        <p>
          The book tells you to clean and check the gap of the plug every 2500 miles and replace every 5000.
        </p>
        <p>
          I could not be bothered to clean and check the plug gap at 2500 miles<br />
          since a new plug only costs £2.99 to £5 dependant on shop.<br />
          That means at 2500 miles the plug is only worth £1.50 to £2.50 so not worth the work of cleaning and checking the gap,<br />
          so I put a new one in.<br />
          I have been told that cleaning spark plugs can go wrong, you ether do not clean it well enough or may even damage it.<br />
          It's also probably a good idea to change a spark plug every year even if you do not do the mileage.
        </p>
        <p>
          You need a NGK DPR8EA-9 spark plug for normal riding and a NGK DPR9EA-9 for extended high speed riding,<br />
          The extended high speed riding spark plug is stated in the Honda CG125 Front Disc brake models Owner's Manual,<br />
          but cannot be totally sure for other models,<br />
          but it makes sense since it's the same spark plug but gets rid of more heat out of the engine<br />
          (that's what the 9 means compared to the 8 in the model number).
        </p>
        <p>
          The following spark plug information is for the front disc brake model,<br />
          I cannot be sure if the same would apply to other models, but it should be relevant.
        </p>
        <p>
          I found that 54mph in 5th gear is high speed for the plug and results in power dropping off if left at that speed for 1/2 mile.<br />
          The power drop off (plug overheating), results in the bike dropping to 50mph against a very strong head wind,<br />
          if you slow down a lot the plug will recover.
        </p>
        <p>
          I fitted the DPR9EA-9 plug and end of problem = no power drop off and the bikes about 5 mph faster.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you use the DPR9EA-9 for slow speed (especially idling a lot in traffic jams),<br />
          there's a chance the plug will not be hot enough<br />
          to burn off petrol burning deposits on the electrode and the bike will stutter or stall.<br />
          I have not had any problems, but would not use it if I was in city traffic all the time with massive amounts of idling,<br />
          of course as soon as you get some speed going the plug will heat up and burn off the deposits.<br />
          The petrol quality could also affect this; I use Shell V Power since it has extra cleaners in it.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can also buy a NGK Iridium spark plug, I got the one that's equivalent to the DPR9EA-9,<br />
          it has made a slight improvement in smoothness, power, pulling power and less vibration.<br />
          Iridium must not be cleaned or the gap changed.<br />
          Iridium plugs often cost 2 to 3 times more than a standard plug, but will last longer,<br />
          I recommend replacing an Iridium every 7,500 miles (due to the gap getting to large),<br />
          that means per mile it works out at the same cost as a standard plug.<br />
          The Iridium plug also claims to burn off deposits more than a normal plug at slow speeds,<br />
          so could help the high speed plug potential problem.<br />
          It also claims to require less power from the battery and ignites the petrol better on cold days.<br />
          In the UK, Halfords sell the NGK Iridium plug in their motorcycle section for £9.49
        </p>
        <p>
          NGK Iridium Spark Plug Conversion chart<br />
          DPR8EA-9 (NGK Normal Plug) = DPR8EIX-9 (NGK Iridium Plug)<br />
          DPR9EA-9 (NGK Normal Plug) = DPR9EIX-9 (NGK Iridium Plug)
        </p>
        <p>
          Older engine, points.<br />
          DR8ES-L (NGK Normal Plug) = DR8EIX (NGK Iridium Plug)<br />
          High speed = DR9EIX (NGK Iridium Plug)

          Remove the spark plug cap on top of the spark plug<br />
          (just pull it off with a slight twist).
        </p>
        <p class="under-img">
          <img alt="" height="178" src="images/spark_plug_tool.gif" style="float: left" width="245" />Remove the spark plug with the tools in the
          bike<br />
          (see <a href="servicing.htm#How-to-find-your-bikes-Tool-Kit-and-Owners-Manual">How to find your bikes Tool Kit and Owners
          Manual</a> in the <a href="servicing.htm">Servicing</a> page).
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have no tools,<br />
          you need an 18 mm spark plug tool<br />
          that's long enough to go over the top of the plug and reach the nut<br />
          (an 18 mm spark plug tool for cars are often to short).<br />
          If it's too tight to turn,<br />
          take the bike for a ride to get it up to heat or if it's already hot, try it stone cold.
        </p>
        <p class="under-img">
          Screw a new plug in hand tight (with no tools), then put the spark plug tool on and tighten it 1/2 a turn.<br />
          If you fit a used spark plug,<br />
          hand tight (with no tools) then put the spark plug tool on and tighten 1/8 to 1/4 turn (standard plug) or 1/16 turn (Iridium plug),<br />
          a turn is 360 degrees.<br />
          Put spark plug cap back on (just push on with a slight twist).
