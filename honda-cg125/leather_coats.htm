        <h1>
          Leather Motorcycle Coats
        </h1>
        <p>
          I used to use two motorcycle leather coats.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first one was cheap and low quality,<br />
          It put a lot of its weight on my shoulders (that's very bad since it's heavy, it should be on your hips).<br />
          The coat was hard to walk in because it restricted the movement in my arms<br />
          (bad quality shape and no stretchable leather or fabric in the movement sections).<br />
          It was also hot because it had no ventilation.
        </p>
        <p>
          My second leather coat was high quality and expensive.<br />
          It is very good and very practical on and off the motorcycle.<br />
          It is adjustable and elastic around my hips so nearly all the coats weight is on my hips,<br />
          there is very little weight on my shoulders,<br />
          sometimes there is a little air between coat and my shoulder / neck (that's very good when using for long periods).<br />
          The arm joints have stretchable leather so it hardly restricts my movement when walking<br />
          (very useful, I can walk for miles easily).<br />
          It has good ventilation, small holes under the arms,<br />
          zips front and back that when open allows the coat to breathe very well in hot weather<br />
          and adjustable vents in the top of the coat.<br />
          It also has all the hard body armour in the arms but still hardly restricts my movement when I am walking.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lots of people will tell you a motorcycle leather coat should be tight and only allow something like a shirt to be worn beneath it.<br />
          I have always used a coat that is slightly too big for me, so I can wear anything beneath the coat.<br />
          As the weather gets colder I put thicker and warmer layers of clothes on underneath the coat.<br />
          When it's really cold I put an outdoor / mountain thick fleece on underneath.<br />
          In the coldest days of winter I put a <a href="motorcycle_clothing.htm#Water-Proofs">Water Proof</a> coat over the leather coat which
          substantially reduces the cold<br />
          (stops the wind getting though the zips and seams).
        </p>
        <p>
          As a result I am able to use the leather coat comfortably almost all year round in the UK.<br />
          The only times I struggle is during the very hottest days of summer (because black leather does not reflect the sun),<br />
          and when it's raining and very windy, because the <a href="motorcycle_clothing.htm#Water-Proofs">Water Proof</a> coat I put over the
          leather,<br />
          increases the wind resistance and how much I am blown about in side winds.
