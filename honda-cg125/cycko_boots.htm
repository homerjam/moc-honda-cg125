          Motorcycle Boots Review
        </h1>
        <p>
          This review is not about a particular brand or model of boots,<br />
          instead it will show you the benefits of finding a good pair of boots and about waterproofing.
        </p>
        <p>
          The review below was written in 2010.<br />
		  All Hein Gericke stores in the UK were closed down or sold to their competitors in 2012 and 2013.<br />
		  The Hein Gericke brand (a German company) was purchased by a Chinese company in late 2013 or early 2014.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img alt="" height="489" src="images/cyckoIII_boots.jpg" style="float: left" width="487" />
        </p>
        <p class="down-60px">
          The Bullson Cycko III boots<br />
          are at the budget end of motorcycle boots Â£99.99.<br />
          And are available at Hein Gericke Stores.
        </p>
        <p>
          They use the Sheltex liner to make them<br />
          waterproof, breathable and windproof.
        </p>
        <p>
          They are a quality, high performance<br />
          and practical boot for all year round use.
        </p>
        <p>
          The height of the boot is ideal,<br />
          allowing you to put motorcycle trousers inside them<br />
          (pushing them up so their weight<br />
          is not on your knees when you walk).<br />
          Shorter boots also do not offer<br />
          as much protection in an accident or from the weather.
        </p>
        <p class="under-img">
          Changing gear and using the rear brake is very good on these boots.<br />
          They have been designed to do it, unlike my last pair of budget motorcycle boots<br />
          (from a well-known big motorcycle company).<br />
          They are even better than high quality walking shoes (which offer very little protection in an accident).
        </p>
        <p>
          The design appears to centre on how they rock on the foot rest<br />
          and how they are angled to go around the gear lever and on to the brake.<br />
          They are designed right and shows how bad<br />
          some other budget motorcycle boots are,<br />
          which must be based on non-motorcycling boots.<br />
          Changing gear is so much easier and better;<br />
          I thought I had a new better gearbox and more powerful rear brake!
        </p>
        <p>
          It uses latex foam for protection in an accident,<br />
          it's so good I did not even realise it's in the boot,<br />
          it does not get in the way like some other types of armour.
        </p>
        <p>
          The boots are comfortable to walk in for well over 1 mile with ease<br />
          (including on very hot days in a city centre or inside a shopping centre).<br />
          I even managed a mountain walk of nearly 2 miles easily.<br />
          Some parts were so steep; sheep had been replaced with mountain goats.<br />
          One section was very steep downhill with a large slab of rock,<br />
          I was easily able to stop on the rock, the boots grip is massive,<br />
          far better than any shoe I have used in the past,<br />
          and the rest of the boot supported my foot and ankle brilliantly.<br />
          This grip should be of use on the bike to stop it falling over on slippery roads (it has an oil and petrol resistant rubber sole).<br />
          Despite my excessive walking and only using very cheap sports socks,<br />
          I did not get any sore sports or blisters on my feet or legs.<br />
          I also had no problem where the short socks end and the boot touches my skin.<br />
          There was also no problem with breathability or heat build-up (despite it being a warm day).<br />
          I would say the breathability and heat build-up are similar to a mid-range black pair of shoes.<br />
          So they have well and truly passed the walking tests.
        </p>
        <p>
          The boots offer a lot of protection from the weather.<br />
          In the cold the Sheltex liner stops the cold wind getting to your feet very well yet is breathable enough on the hottest days.<br />
          The Sheltex also gives you a waterproof barrier from the rain.
        </p>
        <p>
          On a 65 mile ride at -1c to -3c, headwind, no sun with only a single pair of thick thermal socks on,<br />
          my toes were in between cool and warm when I removed the boots.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have also used the boots in a torrential downpour at 60mph for 30mins against a strong headwind.<br />
          The rain was so heavy the road had totally flooded (standing water on entire road surface).<br />
          I even hit a very large puddle that resulted in what felt like a wave of water running over the top of the boots at 60mph.<br />
          The boots did not let in any water and did not soak up much water (so dried very quickly).
        </p>
        <p>
          Every time I have tried a non GORE-TEX waterproof / breathable / windproof material like Sheltex on in the shop,<br />
          I have been dissatisfied with its breathability.<br />
          As a result I would not buy it,<br />
          I would ether buy GORE-TEX or a product without any waterproof / breathable / windproof material.<br />
          But the Sheltex breathability is good enough in a boot,<br />
          but would insist on GORE-TEX for gloves / coat and trousers (despite the cost).<br />
          I have spent far too many years and many miles<br />
          being boiled alive on hot humid summer days / in shops to go back to non GORE-TEX.<br />
          For GORE-TEX clothes I also recommend,<br />
          please see <a href="nagano_coat.htm">GORE-TEX Coat Review</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="atlas_trousers.htm">GORE-TEX Trousers
          Review</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="xtrafit_glove.htm">GORE-TEX X-Trafit gloves Review</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          These boots are so good, I can highly recommend them,<br />
          as a result I use them as my main and only pair of boots all year round.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course there are better boots for much more money.<br />
          But at this price range, I can highly recommend it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Hein Gericke Custom II boot was my first choice,<br />
          but it has no waterproof liner and could be cold in winter, so I have only tried it on in the shop.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Hein Gericke Tivano GORE-TEX boots are really nice,<br />
          but cost far more, but if you have the money, they are worth a look; again I only got to try them on in the shop.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are other GORE-TEX boots to look at, but make sure they are designed for winter use if you plan to ride a bike then.<br />
          When you have the right motorcycle clothes you could easily find you are motorcycling far more and in colder weather<br />
          (when most people hibernate).
        </p>
        <p>
          Don't forget when you buy any new motorcycle boots;<br />
          your gear change lever may need to be adjusted (higher or lower) compared to your old boots.<br />
          So if you find changing gear even slightly more difficult, it's often a sign of the lever is too high or low, not the boots that are
          bad.<br />
          Adjusting the lever is very easy, undo a nut, take off lever and put it back on pointing slightly more up or down.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Update
        </h2>
        <p>
          After riding in medium to heavy rain for 35 miles non-stop in head wind, the boots let in an uncomfortable amount of water.<br />
          The water was then trapped in due to the waterproof liner and so took many days to dry out,<br />
          unlike a non waterproof lined leather boot.<br />
          This problem also happens to loads of other brands and types of breathable waterproof liners in boot form<br />
          (boots are very hard to waterproof).<br />
          It's down to the amount of time and distance travelled before they fail to stop the constant pressure of the water trying to get in.<br />
          I managed to slow down the amount of water and increase the time it takes to get in,<br />
          by using a breathable waterproofing wax on the outside.
        </p>
        <p>
          After doing a lot of research, trying to make a boot waterproof but yet breathable is almost impossible over long distances,<br />
          very few have managed it and even then, a slight defect in the stitching or wear and tear results in water getting in.
        </p>
        <p>
          The only solution I have found effective, is to use waterproof, non breathable material over the front of the boot.<br />
          I found that to be 100% waterproof, even on long trips over 60 miles in heavy rain with head wind.<br />
          But of course a material like that has many disadvantages, but on long trips (over 25 miles) in the rain, they are essential.
