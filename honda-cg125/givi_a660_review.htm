          Givi A660 Screen Review
        </h1>
        <p>
          Also see <a href="screen.htm">Motorcycle Universal Screen Review</a> and <a href="givi_a601_review.htm">Givi A601 Review</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          <img alt="" height="330" src="images/givi_a660.jpg" width="330" /><br />
          The screen is 42.5 cm high (from top of headlight part to tip of screen) and 42 cm wide.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Design
        </h2>
        <p>
          The screen is well designed and performs very well (highly recommended).<br />
          It's so good in every way I assume it has been designed in a wind tunnel or with very advanced computer aided design.
        </p>
        <p>
          The top of the screen is angled upwards to stop the wind being fired straight at rider's helmet.<br />
          This results in low wind noise (turbulence) off the top of the screen.<br />
          It also results in good visibility in the rain.
        </p>
        <p>
          The width of the screen is not too wide or narrow and is curved inwards (so wind is wrapped around screen).<br />
          This results in the screen being very stable in strong winds in any direction (makes bike stable).<br />
          It also results in slow low turbulence (deflected) air reaching the riders helmet and body<br />
          (depending on how far you are away from the screen).<br />
          This air keeps the rider cool in summer (not as cool as no screen of course)<br />
          and yet still keeps the wind chill off the rider in winter.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Review
        </h2>
        <p>
          This screen is very quiet. It's actually much more quiet than with no screen.
        </p>
        <p>
          This review was done on a Honda CG125 motorcycle 2004 to 2008 version (125cc 4 stroke with less than 11hp).
        </p>
        <p>
          I was able to mount the screen 8 cm above the headlight to get the ideal height of just below eye level when riding<br />
          (that's the maximum height possible on that bike).<br />
          The screen actually deflects the wind so it hits above eye level.<br />
          I could also get the screen very close to the instrument panel to reduce the gap between rider and screen<br />
          (rider is long way back due to very upright riding position)
        </p>
        <p>
          Without a screen the bikes normal top speed would be around the 65 mph mark.<br />
          But that could drop to as low as 50 mph against a very strong headwind.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please note, when you go past peak engine revs the power drops off dramatically since it's a push rod engine,<br />
          so it does not matter if it's a 60 mph back wind and downhill,<br />
          when you hit peak engine revs the power drops off and stops you going much faster.<br />
          So when I say top speed increases by so much, that's of course until you hit peak engine revs,<br />
          so top speed increases by so much is only when you have a head wind.
        </p>
        <h2>
          The Good
        </h2>
        <p>
          Top speed with a normal coat was 10 to 15 mph faster than without a screen.<br />
          Top speed with a leather coat was 5 to 7.5 mph faster than without a screen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even with a leather coat on and my chin on the petrol tank without a screen,<br />
          the screen gave at least 3 mph more speed and no need to put my chin on the tank.<br />
          With the screen on there was no change in top speed if I lowered my body since my body was already protected by the screen.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the screen on, leather coat and done all the things in the <a href="improving_performance.htm">Improving Performance</a> page,<br />
          the bike no longer really benefits from sitting behind a 56 mph lorry to increase the top speed against a very strong head wind.<br />
          The screen actually gave more of a speed increase than no screen and sitting behind a lorry (within your braking distance)<br />
          in very strong head wind.<br />
          So at last against a very strong head wind (you can only manage 60 mph),<br />
          you can easily overtake a lorry while it's accelerating,<br />
          or against a strong head wind overtake the 56 mph lorry with the bike managing 65 mph.<br />
          And after you have overtaken the lorry,<br />
          you will be able to at least manage and keep up 60 mph even with a strong head wind and uphill.<br />
          The speeds above are for someone around 5 foot 10 inches tall and around 11 stone (70 kg).<br />
          Since the bike is small and underpowered, if you are significantly larger or heavier, you will be slower.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even with leather coat on, fuel consumption improved by 5% even though bike was travelling faster,<br />
          so after several thousand miles the screen would pay for itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          The bike is much more stable in near gale force side winds.
        </p>
        <p>
          Going round corners was more stable and faster due to less wind resistance,<br />
          which creates in effect more power from the engine to pull you round the corner<br />
          and the wind cannot push you in another direction as much.
        </p>
        <h2>
          The Bad
        </h2>
        <p>
          It's pretty hard to find anything bad with this screen unless it's too tall for you<br />
          (most riders do not like having to look through a screen).
        </p>
        <p>
          Since the screen reduces the wind resistance so much the brakes have to work harder<br />
          and if you increase speed engine revs are higher.
        </p>
        <p>
          The increase in speed could tempt you to cruise the bike above 65 mph,<br />
          I advise against going past this speed for a long time since it will increase engine wear substantially.<br />
          So go above 65 mph for overtaking traffic only.<br />
          What causes the engine wear is not only the extra high engine revs,<br />
          it's also the longer you're at those engine revs the more heat build-up you get.<br />
          I personally would never go to 70 mph since the engine revs are far too high,<br />
          going past this speed even for a quick test is crazy unless you do not care about engine life<br />
          (to far above 70 mph could cause engine damage).<br />
          I personally cruise on normal roads at 60 mph (to protect engine),<br />
          on dual carriage ways where the speed limit is 70 mph<br />
          I often cruise at 63 mph if traffic is fast moving or even 65 mph for short periods.<br />
          I limit my overtaking speed to 66 mph.<br />
          With prolonged high engine speeds, the oil you use and changing it earlier than normal is critical,<br />
          see <a href="oil.htm#Which-Oil-quality-to-use">Which Oil quality to use</a> in the <a href="servicing.htm">Servicing</a>
          page.<br />
          With the best oil, if the majority of the mileage was done at 60 mph with a substantial amount above 60 mph<br />
          I would change the oil every 1500 to 1750 miles.<br />
          All of the above speeds are based on the 5 speed gearbox and using 5th gear, a 4 speed gearbox could easily be different.<br />
          The 5 speed bike was the Front Disc Brake model, to see the RPM of the engine have a look at the <a href="mph_to_rpm.htm">MPH to RPM</a>
          page.<br />
          For all other models of Honda CG125 look at the speedometer,<br />
          look carefully and it should show you the maximum advised speed in every gear.
