        <h1>
          Honda CG125 Owners Club
        </h1>
        <p>
          I have also created a combined <a href="http://125ccbikeclub.awardspace.co.uk/">Honda CBF125 Honda CBR125 Yamaha YBR125 Owners Club</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          This website is the only one that supports the Honda CG125 motorcycle to my knowledge.<br />
          It has been designed for the whole world, but has more specific information for the UK where indicated.
        </p>
        <p>
          It covers all the important things in the Owner's Manual and often in far more detail.<br />
          It also covers lots of things not in the Owner's Manual.<br />
          I have not put a forum on the website because all Honda CG125 motorbike forums have failed to really work in the past.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hope you find this website helpful. None of it, including all the servicing needs any skills or expensive tools.<br />
          Someone who has never seen or read about motorcycles and has no natural mechanical talent could easily manage it.<br />
          The bike was deliberately designed that way including, oil change, spark plug, valve clearance, air filter, chain tension.
        </p>
        <p>
          This website supports all Honda CG125 models / versions from the original 1976 to the 2008 model.<br />
          All around the world from 1976 to 2008 all Honda CG125 used a carburettor and an OHV engine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since 2009 all new motorcycles in most countries around the world stopped using OHV engines due to new emission laws.<br />
          In most countries they have replaced the Honda CG125 with the Honda CBF125; others use a modern Honda CB125.<br />
          But in Brazil they put an OHC engine in to the Honda CG125.<br />
          I expect all these Honda air cooled OHC engines since 2009 use the same engine as the CBF125.<br />
          To confirm this, please check the engine Bore and Stroke is 52.4 x 57.8mm in the specifications.<br />
          This website does not support OHC engines or fuel injection but my other website does (a link to it is at the top of this page).
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2013 a very few countries still sell any new Honda CG125 with the OHV engine,<br />
          Pakistan sell the CG125 and the CG125 Deluxe.<br />
          They are a mix of Honda CG125 parts from many years ago<br />
          and a few other parts like a 2 piston disc brake on some models (this website does not fully support 2 piston).
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2004 the Honda CG125 in the UK and Europe had a major model change,<br />
          the front drum brake was replaced with a 1 piston disc brake,<br />
          it's much more powerful than a drum if you see <a href="brakes.htm#How-to-improve-the-Front-Disc-Brake">How to improve the
          Front Disc Brake</a>.<br />
          Honda made several other changes including reducing the strength of the <a href="general.htm#Choke">Choke</a> and adding an <a href=
          "basic_fault_finding.htm#Air-Suction-Valve">Air Suction Valve</a>.
        </p>
