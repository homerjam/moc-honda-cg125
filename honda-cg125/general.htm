        </h2>
        <p>
          Never use a pressure washer to clean any motorcycle, water can get in to wheel bearings and in to the electrical system.<br />
          I have never needed to use any detergent or shampoo on a motorcycle (I just use water).<br />
          At least one motorcycle manufacturer advises you not to use washing up liquid since it contains salt that will scratch paintwork.<br />
          I use on paintwork, chrome and glass<br />
          a General Microfiber Cleaning Cloth (often sold for normal house cleaning),<br />
          which is very good at removing grease, dirt and insects, but is not the best finish.<br />
          I also use a Genuine Chamois Wash Leather (available from car shops, do not get the artificial type),<br />
          which is not good at removing grease, dirt or insects but leaves a smear free finish.<br />
          A Spectacle / Camera Microfiber Cleaning Cloth (used to clean mirrors, instruments and helmet visors), is good at everything.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also use Mer Car polish<br />
          (every 6 months to 2 years on the paintwork to make it really shine and make it slippery so insects do not stick like glue).<br />
          Mer Car polish is expensive but you use hardly any on a motorcycle so the smallest bottle will last almost forever.<br />
          I also use it on the Silencer / Exhaust and it can be used on any of the chrome on the bike (I have never bothered).<br />
          See Silencer / Exhaust section only in <a href="riding_in_winter.htm#Bike">Bike</a> part of <a href="riding_in_winter.htm">Riding In
          Winter</a> page to see how to remove rust and stop rust coming back.
        </p>
        <p>
          If I need a strong degreaser to remove for instants months of chain oil from the back wheel,<br />
          I would use WD40 (only because I having it around anyway) and an old cloth.<br />
          WD40 is a very powerful degreaser and flows like water in to all the very small places,<br />
          this is very bad if it gets in to the wheel bearings and other places<br />
          since it will get past the rubber seals and dissolve the bearing grease.<br />
          So spray only a small amount on to the back wheel and rub with a cloth,<br />
          it often leaves a WD40 film of oil afterwards, do not let it get on the silencer or it will stain.<br />
          I normally do not bother to remove the chain oil from the back wheel since it protects the wheel and prevents rust.

        <p>
          You can adjust the Gear Change Lever height to the size of your boots or shoes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The motorcycle dealers often set it pointing down,<br />
          which is totally wrong for a Honda CG125 since the riding position is upright not forward.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Owner's Manual shows the gear change lever at the same height as the foot rest (level with the foot rest).<br />
          I found this to be correct for my boots and expect it to be the same for most people.

          To adjust the gear change lever,<br />
          remove the nut bolt (10 mm),<br />
          take the lever off the bike,<br />
          put it back on in the correct position,<br />
          put the nut bolt back in,<br />
          (if you do not put the gear lever back far enough<br />
          or to far back, the bolt will not go through).

        </p>
        <p>
          You can adjust it by turning the bottom of the suspension around.<br />
          You may be able to turn it with your hands if you are strong enough,<br />
          if not use the C spanner (may need the extension shaft),<br />

          When the suspension is new,<br />
          the lowest setting (opposite to stiff) is not normally used since it's for light people with smooth roads.<br />

          The maximum setting (stiffest) is for carrying a passenger.
        </p>
        <p>
          The correct suspension setting for you will depend on your weight and how old / worn the suspension is;<br />
          all springs age / wear and drop in stiffness.<br />
          It's simply a matter of trial and error, it will affect how well the bike handles round bends and handles bumps in the road.

          <a name="How-to-stop-your-engine-from-clogging-up"></a> How to stop your engine from clogging up
        </h2>
        <p>
          It's a good idea with any engine, if it's only been on short trips, like 5 miles to work,<br />
          to take the bike for a long fast ride to clean it out.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any engine that does not get up to full temperature (low engine revs or short trips)<br />
          will get condensation inside and burning deposits will build up excessively,<br />
          that's why you have to change the oil more often in these cases,<br />
          but you still need to take the bike out for a long fast ride from time to time, it can also help the chain.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lots of people think the Honda CG125 has a small engine,<br />
          so it will get up to full temperature very quickly<br />
          and its engine speeds are much higher in normal operation than larger engines.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well the temperature takes a lot longer than many think, 5 miles just does not get it up to full heat.<br />
          I have noticed that if you do loads of 5 mile trips at 40mph in 5<sup>th</sup> gear the bike suffers.
        </p>
        <p>
          But when you take it out for a 50mph or faster run,<br />
          of at least 15 miles it cleans itself out (you still need to change the oil more frequently).
        </p>
        <p>
          You may notice the bike starts better; idling is faster and healthier, less vibration, smoother and more power.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you do a lot of short, slow trips try to have a long fast one now and again.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can also buy better quality petrol that has extra cleaners in to reduce the problem (see <a href="#Petrol">Petrol</a> below).

          The choke lever is underneath the left hand side of the petrol tank.<br />
          When the lever is up (position a) the choke is on and down (position b) it's off.
        </p>
        <p>
          A few of the Front Drum brake models have reversed the choke lever so down is on and up is off.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Choke on some Front Drum brake models may not be needed in summer (when the outside air is hot).
        </p>
        <p>
          The following is for the Front Disc brake model,<br />
          some of it may be true for Front Drum brake models (not all of it since their emission controls are not so strict).
        </p>
        <p>
          As long as you have the <a href="idle_screws.htm#Idle-Mixture-Screw">Idle Mixture Screw</a> and <a href=
          "idle_screws.htm#Idle-speed-screw">Idle Speed Screw</a> set right (see <a href="idle_screws.htm">Idle Screws</a> page) all the
          following is true.
        </p>
        <p>
          Half choke is never any real use; bike still needs full choke on a hot summer's day.<br />
          The bike has a very small window of when half choke works like 2 seconds or never.<br />
          Never leave the choke half on when the engine does not need choke,<br />
          over time it will damage the engine, the bike will not stall when idling with half choke.
        </p>
        <p>
          Full choke is not strong enough when engine is stone cold in the middle of winter;<br />
          you have to generate heat by turning the engine over a few times,<br />
          below 10c a small heater is also activated to help.
        </p>
        <p>
          To start the bike from stone cold, put choke fully on.<br />
          Open the throttle 1/8 to 1/4 turn,<br />
          hold it open and then press the starter button<br />
          (see <a href="#Choke-when-the-bike-has-been-standing-for-days">Choke when the bike has been standing for days</a> below if
          hard to start).<br />
          When the bike starts you must keep the revs up or it will stall.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you get the bike hot enough for it to idle without choke, you may find the bike stalls when you open the throttle,<br />
          simply restart with full choke, this will happen when the bike is almost ready to come off choke.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the engine is stone cold, it will need choke for a long time.<br />
          I advise you to warm the engine up (choke on) while riding the bike,<br />
          unless you're not experienced with controlling the bike.
        </p>
        <p>
          Riding the bike with the choke on is easy,<br />
          until you try to change down a gear since you will probably try to let the engine idle,<br />
          when of course it will just die.<br />
          The secret is to make sure you keep the engine revs much higher than idle to stop this.<br />
          Finding the choke lever while moving takes practice, try with thin or no gloves to begin with.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the bike has been switched off for only a few hours, put choke fully on,<br />
          start the engine with a little throttle (1/8 to 1/4 of a turn), blip the throttle 3 or 4 times and turn the choke off.<br />
          I advise you to warm the engine up (choke on) without riding the bike since it's only 3 to 4 blips of the throttle.

        <p>
          See <a href="#Choke">Choke</a> above before reading the following.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following is for the Front Disc brake model,<br />
          some of it may be true for Front Drum brake models (not all of it since their emission controls are not so strict).<br />
          The petrol evaporates over time.<br />
          If you use it every day, the bike will usually start with the first turn of the engine.<br />
          If it has been standing for a few days, it will take more turns of the engine,<br />
          every day can add an extra turn of the engine (sometimes).<br />
          At worst it could take around 10 turns.<br />
          For every 5 seconds that the electric starter is used, you must give it a 10 second rest.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have found it best to turn the engine over once,<br />
          let it rest for 2 seconds and try again, keep repeating this sequence until you hear it fire.
        </p>
        <p>
          If it fires once and then dies,<br />
          try the same sequence again or<br />
          try turning the engine over 2 or 3 times without a rest or<br />
          turn the engine over with the throttle closed (as soon as the engine fires, open the throttle 1/8 to 1/4 turn to keep it going).
        </p>
        <p>
          If the bike really refuses to start and keep going,<br />
          switch the ignition key off for 30 seconds or longer to let the battery recover to full voltage, then try again.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have flooded the engine with petrol,<br />
          switch the choke off and open the throttle fully and turn the engine over several times.<br />
          If it still fails to start, switch the petrol tap off and turn the engine over several times,<br />
          then switch the petrol tap back on and try the normal starting procedure<br />
          (it will take several turns of the engine to get petrol back in).
        </p>
        <p>
          When the bikes running, the petrol in the carburettor is still partly stale (gone off / evaporated),<br />
          expect the bike to need choke for longer than normal and to feel rough,<br />
          until the carburettor has been fully refilled with petrol from the tank (could take 0.5 miles).
        </p>
        <p>
          All this trouble might be eliminated if you leave the petrol tap on all the time,<br />
          but mechanics warn that over time the petrol will seep out and fall all over the bike and floor.

        <p>
          Starting a Honda CG125 and not being able to idle with the choke on<br />
          is totally different to most other makes and models of motorcycle.<br />
          It's because the choke is very primitive.<br />
          Nearly all chokes (except the Honda CG125 one) increase the idle speed when they are switched on.<br />
          Because the Honda CG125 does not increase the idle speed, you have to do it manually by opening the throttle slightly.<br />
          All engines need both choke and the idle speed increased in order to work (when engine is too cold to work without choke).<br />
          So the Honda CG125 needs the throttle held open slightly and only then can you start the bike (while it's open).<br />
          Other makes and models of motorcycle would only start if the throttle is closed (if it was open you would flood the engine).
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes the Honda CG125 might require the throttle closed<br />
          to start the engine (but the second it starts you must open the throttle).<br />
          This will only happen after at least one un successful start with the throttle slightly open,<br />
          this is because there would be some un burnt fuel in the engine.
        </p>
        <p>
          A few people have increased the Honda CG125 idle speed to make it idle with the choke on.<br />
          This requires the idle speed to be excessively higher than the bike was designed for.<br />
          It makes it very easy to start the bike,<br />
          but it will damage the engine when it is up to heat and does not need choke anymore.<br />
          The problems of excessively high idle speeds are.<br />
          Increased Fuel Consumption.<br />
          Engine will overheat when idling for a long time while stationary and in slow moving traffic<br />
          (overheating is very bad for the engine).<br />
          Changing gear can become more difficult and even stop you changing gear<br />
          (especially when everything overheats when stationary and in slow moving traffic).<br />
          There are probably other problems of excessively high idle speeds;<br />
          I very strongly recommend you do not increase the idle speed above the designed speed.

          it makes starting the bike harder and needs choke more often and for longer.<br />
          You can also reduce the amount of time the choke is needed for by improving the quality of the petrol<br />
          (see <a href="#Petrol">Petrol</a> section below).

          <a name="Clutch" id="Clutch"></a>Clutch
        </h2>
        <p>
          It is easy to blame yourself for a poor quality clutch,<br />
          thinking it's you not being sensitive enough on the clutch or you not getting the throttle to clutch right.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you wear out a clutch on any make or model of bike,<br />
          I highly recommend fitting EBC clutch plates and clutch springs,<br />
          instead of the bike manufacturer's genuine parts (which might not even be the same as originally fitted).
        </p>
        <p>
          EBC have a reputation for making high quality and performance parts including their clutches.<br />
          My clutch tests also back this up and as a result,<br />
          I would expect EBC to outperform your original clutch or at worst equal it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course I cannot test every make and model of motorcycle, but I do know the quality of EBC.<br />
          They even make their clutch springs 10 to 15% stiffer,<br />
          which only makes the clutch lever very slightly heavier (the muscles in your hand very quickly adapt),<br />
          but also results in much better clutch performance and less slipping (even on a 125cc bike).
        </p>
        <p>
          EBC make 3 types of Clutch plates for road motorcycles.<br />
          Standard CK series (that's what I have tried and are available for a very large amount of motorcycles).<br />
          and 2 Race / Sports Clutch plates (only available for some bikes).
        </p>
        <p>
          I was able to compare the EBC clutch to my Front Disc brake models original clutch (even when both were brand new),<br />
          the EBC Clutch is so much smoother and makes off the line starts perfect every time (no juddering),<br />
          even when you make a mistake.<br />
          I did not realise it at the time, but the original plates were always slipping slightly<br />
          (nothing to do with the oil myth, even happened on semi synthetic).<br />
          The EBC plates do not appear to be slipping,<br />
          resulting in a better connection between gearbox and rear wheel (more power and smoother power delivery).
        </p>
        <h2>
          <a name="Gearbox" id="Gearbox"></a>Gearbox
        </h2>
        <p>
          The gearbox was improved with the Front Disc brake model, so the following may not be true for Front Drum models.
        </p>
        <p>
          The faults below are due to the clutch or gearbox overheating due to bad design.<br />
          You can improve the overheating by using better quality oil.<br />
          Silkolene Comp 4 (real semi synthetic) engine oil was not able to stop the faults.<br />
          Silkolene Pro 4 Plus 5W-40 engine oil has substantially reduced the problem (see <a href="oil.htm#Silkolene-Pro-4-Plus">Silkolene Pro
          4 Plus</a> for more information).<br />
          I then tried an EBC Clutch (see <a href="#Clutch">Clutch</a> above), which improved things even more.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you are in 5th gear and want to change down to 3rd or below,<br />
          you must let the clutch out in 4th gear.<br />
          If you do not, the gearbox will refuse to change down to 3rd or below,<br />
          until you let the clutch out (in 4th gear) and then pull it in again.<br />
          If you are stuck with this problem at a standstill,<br />
          with the throttle closed, let the clutch out just enough so the engine starts to connect to the back wheel,<br />
          then pull the clutch back in before the engine stalls.<br />
          When the fault is fixed you will hear a mechanical click from the gearbox.<br />
          Sometimes rocking the bike forwards and backwards while blipping the throttle also works.
        </p>
        <p>
          The gearbox / clutch will overheat if for instance,<br />
          you race from one set of stopped traffic lights to another a short distance away on a hot day.<br />
          You will not have any problems if you let the clutch out in every gear when changing down,<br />
          but the gearbox will refuse to change down if you do not.<br />
          When it refuses to change down and you're stuck at a standstill,<br />
          with the throttle closed, let the clutch out just enough so the engine starts to connect to the back wheel,<br />
          then pull the clutch back in before the engine stalls.<br />
          When the fault is fixed you will hear a mechanical click from the gearbox.<br />
          You can also just wait for things to cool down.

          <a name="Petrol-Tank"></a>Petrol Tank
        </h2>
        <p>
          The Front Disc brake model has a petrol meter and a redesigned petrol tank,<br />
          unlike the Front Drum brake model.<br />
          The following is for the Front Disc brake model.
        </p>
        <p>
          The petrol tank holds 13.5 litres = 3 gallons.
        </p>
        <p>
          The petrol meter reads flat out full until the first gallon (4.54 litres) has been used.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the petrol meter needle is half way between full and empty the tank is half full.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the petrol tap is set to on (not reserve),<br />
          the bike will run out of petrol shortly after the needle has gone past empty and gone off the scale.
        </p>
        <p>
          The bike will normally run out of petrol when the bike is slowing down, not speeding up.<br />
          It then takes around 10 turns of the starter motor to get the engine running,<br />
          by using the reserve position on the fuel tap.<br />
          I have always opened the throttle 1/8 to 1/4 turn when pressing the starter button,<br />
          but it could be worth trying with the throttle closed after a few turns.<br />
          You may need to rest the starter motor for 2 seconds between some of the turns,<br />
          or even switch the ignition key off for 30 seconds to let the battery recover.<br />
          I advise against running out of petrol since this takes a long time and holds up traffic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Without reserve the bike seems to run out of petrol when there is still 3.5 (normally) to 2.5 litres still in the bike,<br />
          unless it runs out while not slowing down. I have run on reserve until there was only 1 litre of petrol in the bike.<br />
          I would not go below 1 litre since the petrol may not find its way down the petrol pipe.<br />
          Reserve officially holds 2.3 litres.
        </p>

          This section was last updated in March 2014<br />

          In the UK I very highly recommend you never use supermarket petrol in any engine including motorcycles and cars.<br />
          The only branded petrol that I would dare to put in any of my petrol engines are Shell, BP, Esso, Texaco, Jet, Gulf.<br />
          I am not alone in making the above statements,<br />
          many car and motorcycle mechanics and shops have been going on for years about never use supermarket petrol.<br />
          Supermarket fuel has been causing so much trouble over the last few years;<br />
          some shops have been telling their customers when they pick up their new car / motorcycle,<br />
          that if they put supermarket petrol in it their warrantee will be invalid.
        </p>
        <p>
          Supermarket fuel may often be cheaper,<br />
          but you may well find your fuel economy reduces making it more expensive than branded petrol.<br />
          Your throttle may also become sluggish.<br />
          But the most worrying problems may include the purity of the petrol (contamination),<br />
          stale petrol (gone off) and not enough cleaners.<br />
          If the cleaners are not strong enough,<br />
          burning deposits will build up reducing the performance of the engine and may well increase engine wear.
        </p>
        <p>
          If it was an emergency and I had no choice but to use supermarket fuel.<br />
          I would only use Tesco and only if they sell 2 types of petrol, the most expensive one is the only thing I would dare to use.
        </p>
        <p>
          All but the smallest petrol stations that sell Shell, BP, Esso, Texaco, Jet or Gulf have two types of petrol.<br />
          The cheapest petrol is the standard unleaded.<br />
          The expensive petrol is their quality unleaded,<br />
          it is not only higher octane but often has more / better cleaners<br />
          and performance enhancing things in it (maybe even better fuel economy).
        </p>
        <p>
          The expensive petrol should really be called super unleaded, but every company has come up with their own name for it.<br />
          Super unleaded often has less or no Ethanol in it compared to standard unleaded.<br />
          Super unleaded of different brands will perform differently and will depend on your engine,<br />
          so the only way to find what's best is to try them all in your engine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please note petrol does go off with age,<br />
          super unleaded does not sell in large quantities so a remote / small petrol station may have old stock.<br />
          Many BMW, Mercedes, Subaru cars can only run on super unleaded,<br />
          they are often found at branded petrol stations on busy roads.<br />
          So the places they go to will often have fresher stock.
        </p>
        <p>
          From time to time any petrol station of any brand or supermarket can have a faulty batch of petrol or a contaminated tank.<br />
          If your engine suddenly shows symptoms of bad fuel, try to avoid that petrol station for a while.
        </p>
        <p>
          Below are the results I had experimenting with petrol in my engine a few years ago.<br />
          Please note petrol has and still is changing a lot due to the UK government forcing more ethanol in to petrol.<br />
          The amount of ethanol in petrol often depends on the brand and where the petrol station is in the UK.
        </p>
        <p>
          Super unleaded is much better than normal unleaded in at least the Front Disc Brake Honda CG125 engine.<br />
          The effects of super unleaded and the different makes will depend on the engine design,<br />
          the following results are from the Front Disc brake model Honda CG125,<br />
          another make or model of bike / car engine (or even the Front Drum Brake model Honda CG125),<br />
          might have less improvement or no noticeable improvement or improve even more.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started off with Sainsbury's super unleaded which is only 2p a litre more than unleaded,<br />
          the bike increased in power, torque (pulling power) and the engine ran smoother.<br />
          The improvement was largest in the lower and mid rev range of the engine.
        </p>
        <p>
          I then tried Shell Super (it's called V Power, the old version was called Optimax)<br />
          that costs 7p a litre more than normal unleaded.<br />
          The Shell Super improved my petrol consumption by more than 7p a litre,<br />
          the bike increased in power, torque (pulling power) and the engine ran smoother.<br />
          The improvement was largest in the lower and mid rev range of the engine.<br />
          That was all compared to the Sainsbury's super unleaded.<br />
          I would say the jump from normal unleaded to Sainsbury's super was small compared to the jump to Shell super.<br />
          The Shell super also kept improving all of the above the more I used it,<br />
          it took a tank or two before it slowed the improving down to a crawl.<br />
          It does claim to have extra cleaning powers to clean out your engine and improve all of the above.<br />
          It also significantly reduced the amount of time the choke is on for.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can mix any super unleaded brand with another brand of super unleaded or normal unleaded,<br />
          but expect the improvement to only be 50% if you only have 50% super with 50% normal unleaded.
        </p>
        <p>
          Which brand of super unleaded petrol is best for your engine I cannot say.<br />
          The best way is for you to test them yourself. You may or may not find a large difference between them.<br />
          Watch out for fuel consumption, cleaning and performance differences.<br />
          I went back to Sainsbury's super (put nearly a whole tank of it in),<br />
          immediately the bike lost most of the Shell V Power differences.<br />
          But as I used more and more of the Sainsbury's super in the tank,<br />
          the bike got slower and slower (no Shell V Power to keep it clean).<br />
          When I was down to half a tank, I filled up with Shell V Power and got half the benefits back.<br />
          This proves the engine was being cleaned by Shell V Power and Sainsbury's Super was making the engine dirtier,<br />
          like normal unleaded.<br />
