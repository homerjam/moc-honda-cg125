          History of the Engine<br />
          <a href="http://world.honda.com/history/challenge/1975cg125/index.html">http://world.honda.com/history/challenge/1975cg125/index.html</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          The Honda CG125 is 124cc in engine size.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's an Overhead Valve design (push rod) from 1976 to 2008.<br />
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushrod">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushrod</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          It's basically a Honda CB125 engine, except it is Overhead Valve instead of Overhead Cam.<br />
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overhead_cam">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overhead_cam</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          An Overhead Cam is more complicated and needs more servicing (servicing is critical) but gives better engine performance.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Overhead Valve system is needed for the third world,<br />
          who demanded easy servicing (also survive if engine never serviced), easy to repair and cheap.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Honda CB125 and Honda CG125 engines are used in other Honda motorcycles (not sure about 2009 models onwards).<br />
          As a general rule, as long as it's a Honda Motorcycle (not sure about scooters),<br />
          4 stroke, Air Cooled (not liquid cooled) &amp; single cylinder,<br />
          if it says overhead valve (OHV) it's the CG125 engine, if it says overhead cam (OHC) it's the CB125.
        </p>
        <p>
          The 125cc engine size history is complicated,<br />
          a long time ago the learner laws of the UK and several other countries was 250cc.<br />
          250cc engines over time increased in power output, until they were too powerful for the UK and the several other countries,<br />
          so they changed the law to 125cc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Back then 125cc was an uncommon size, but due to the law,<br />
          125cc engines became common in the countries with the 125cc learner law.<br />
          In countries without the learner law, 125cc has never caught on (except third world countries that use whatever is cheapest).<br />
          Before the 125cc learner law 150cc was common.
        </p>
        <p>
          Engine manufacturers hate to build and design new engines, so they normally just convert the engine to the size required.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reducing the engine size is the easiest and safest since the engine will have less power;<br />
          this means less strain on all the other components of the engine and bike.<br />
          All you have to do to reduce the engine size,<br />
          is put a sleeve or larger sleeve in the cylinder and change the piston to a smaller one.<br />
          You can also change the crank so the piston does not move as far up and down the cylinder (called the Stroke).
        </p>
        <p>
          Manufacturers often increase the engine size above the original design of the engine and this normally has side effects.<br />
          The side effects often include,<br />
          increased vibration and components not lasting as long (they may change or improve some components to compensate).<br />
          To increase the engine size you need to bore out the cylinder (barrel) or change the sleeve or change the cylinder<br />
          (the size is called the Bore).<br />
          Sometimes they are able to change the crank so the piston moves further up and down the cylinder (called the Stroke).
        </p>
        <p>
          All Honda CG125 &amp; Honda CB125 engines have always been (1976 to 2008)<br />
          Bore x Stroke 56.5 x 49.5 mm
        </p>
        <p>
          I then wondered if there was a Honda CB150 in the past and found there was,<br />
          the Honda CB125 maybe a converted Honda CB150.
        </p>
        <p>
          That made me wonder if there are still Honda CB or CG150 being made today, this is what I have found.
        </p>
        <p>
          In brazil <a href="http://www.honda.com.br/">http://www.honda.com.br/</a> (Portuguese language) were the latest Honda CG125 are made,<br />
          they also put a 150cc Overhead Cam engine in developing just over 13hp (125cc = 11hp) and called it the Honda CG150.<br />
          Its Bore x Stroke is 57.3 x 57.8 mm, 149.2 cc, 9.5 :1 compression, peak power 8000 rpm, peak torque 6500 rpm.<br />
          From 2009 onwards,<br />
          Brazil have continued to make the Honda CG125<br />
          but it looks like it's probably using the same 125cc engine as the India Honda CBF125 (see below).<br />
          So the Honda CG150 and CG125 currently being made in Brazil<br />
          should be called CB150 and CB125 since they are overhead cam engines.<br />
          I guess the CG name is so big in Brazil they did not want to lose it.<br />
          I assume the old Overhead Valve engine was abandoned due to emission laws.
        </p>
        <p>
          India <a href="http://www.honda2wheelersindia.com/">http://www.honda2wheelersindia.com/</a> has started making the next generation of Honda
          third world bikes;<br />
          its first is the Unicorn.<br />
          It's a bit heavy, but notice the mono shock suspension,<br />
          fuel economy we can only dream of, Overhead Cam, 150cc engine etc.<br />
          It looks like it's called a Honda CBF150 in other countries.<br />
          The engine may or may not be totally different to the Honda CG and CB engines.<br />
          I would not be surprised if it's the same engine as the 150cc Brazil Honda CG150 (see above).
        </p>
        <p>
          India has also released a Honda CBF125 also called the Honda Stunner (in 2008), it has an Overhead Cam.<br />
          It has been converted to fuel injection for the UK and European market<br />
          to replace the Honda CG125 due to the Euro 3 emission law in 2009.<br />
          The Honda CBF125 Bore and Stroke is 52.4 x 57.8mm which is totally different sizes to the CG125 and CB125 engines.<br />
          The Honda CBF125 engine may or may not be a totally different engine to the CG125 and CB125 engines.<br />
          But notice the Honda CBF125 Stroke is identical to the Brazil Honda CG150 mentioned above.
        </p>
        <p>
          Engine performance is not only about power output.
        </p>
        <p>
          You also need to look at the torque output; this is the amount of pulling power,<br />
          very important when going uphill or head wind or heavy loads.<br />
          The larger the engine size the more torque output you will get.
        </p>
        <p>
          You also want to look at the state of tune, you can tune an engine to give maximum power output (high state of tune),<br />
          but the engine will only produce that power at the top of the rev range<br />
          and below that the power and torque output will be very low.<br />
          The Honda CG125 is in a low state of tune, this means the maximum power output is low,<br />
          but that means you will get far more power and torque in the low to mid-range of the rev band<br />
          than a 125cc engine in a high state of tune.
