        <p>
          Numbness (loss of feeling), tingling (pins and needles) and bone pain can be caused by handlebar vibration.<br />
          It can affect hands, fingers and arms; the vibration normally comes from the engine.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can reduce the problem by not griping the handlebar so tightly, relax your fingers and arms,<br />
          keep fingers off clutch and brake levers until absolutely necessary.<br />
          Reduce the weight on your hands by using your stomach and leg muscles more.
        </p>
        <p>
          The amount of vibration is related to engine speed, load (headwind speed, steepness of hill etc.) and which gear the bikes in.<br />
          For example going up a very steep hill at 40mph in 3rd gear,<br />
          the vibration would be low, but on a flat road the vibration would be terrible at that speed in that gear.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some gloves have thicker leather or padding in the finger part of the glove than others<br />
          (downsides are reduced feel and not as good as methods below).
        </p>
        <p>
          Using a higher quality engine oil,<br />
          may reduce vibration (depending on engine); see <a href="oil.htm#Which-Oil-quality-to-use">Which Oil quality to use</a> (Silkolene
          Pro 4 Plus section).
        </p>
        <h2>
          Foam Brake and Clutch Lever covers
        </h2>
        <p>
          The largest amount of vibration comes from the brake and clutch levers since they are metal with no padding.<br />
          You can buy universal motorcycle round foam lever covers<br />
          that will remove all the vibration (costs around £2 to £3 a pair in the UK).<br />
          I do not recommend them to people with short fingers since they increase the size of the levers<br />
          (if your glove size is medium to large you will be ok).<br />
          The foam lever covers will also improve grip and control of the levers.
        </p>
        <p>
          The foam has rubber inside and can expand by a large amount to go over the lever end,<br />
          put a small amount of washing up liquid over the rubber to allow it to slide over the levers,<br />
          let it dry for up to a day before use to stop the excessive sliding.<br />
          Do not stick the foam covers on with glue; they need to slide forwards and backwards in places when you use the levers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Foam covers can be found on the internet and ebay by searching for motorcycle foam lever covers.

          Dual Compound Handlebar Grips
        </h2>
        <p>
          I use 135mm Motrax Fas' Grips which are dual compound, but unfortunately the company no longer exists.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other companies make Dual Compound grips.<br />
          They are only available in 125mm length or less and probably closed end<br />
          (some are designed to have the end cut off to make them open).<br />
          Companies like PROGRIP make them and can often be found in off road motorcycle shops<br />
          (since off road bikes often suffer from vibration).<br />
          Be careful when buying dual compound grips,<br />
          since some are far better designed for off road use than others (fat instead of thin).
        </p>
        <p>
          The Motrax Fas' Grips (are thin, designed for road use)<br />
          are brilliant at removing vibration from the engine as well as vibration from holes in the road.<br />
          They do not appear to have any side effects (unlike Foam grips).<br />
          They are Dual Compound type (dual compound simply means 2 materials are used),<br />
          the first compound is a special anti-vibration material.<br />
          Then there is a more durable rubber material on top to reduce wear from the rider's hands.
        </p>
        <p>
          I expect you will find the other manufacturers of Dual Compound grips similar to the Motrax Fas' Grips.<br />
          They may say they have gel or soft rubber on the inside.
        </p>
        <p>
          To work out what length of grip you need simply measure the length of your old grip with a ruler.<br />
          Nearly all motorcycles that are used on the road are 125mm or 135mm.<br />
          If you have handlebar weights at the end you need open ended (if not you need closed).<br />
          Off road style bikes may be 115mm or 125mm.<br />
          Custom (Harley style) bikes may be something over 135mm.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any anti vibration grip could easily remove so much vibration,<br />
          you could easy over rev the engine if you do not have a rev (rpm) counter,<br />
          for example it may be easy to over rev the engine in 4th gear since you think you are in 5th due to lack of vibration,<br />
          so keep an eye on which gear you're in and the speedometer until you adapt to the lack of vibration.<br />
          Or if you have a Honda CG125 see <a href="mph_to_rpm.htm">MPH to RPM</a> page.

          Foam Handlebar Grips
        </h2>
        <p>
          Foam is the old fashioned way to reduce vibration;<br />
          they have terrible side effects<br />
          and do not reduce vibration anywhere near as well as the Dual Compound Grips mentioned above.<br />
          I have used foam grips for many thousands of miles; I then replaced them with the Dual Compounds Grips mentioned above.<br />
          If you need 135mm length grips, they may be your only choice (they stretch a bit),<br />
          but they are only worth trying if you have very bad vibration problems,<br />
          be prepared to try them and then have to replace them with normal grips.
        </p>
        <h2>
          How to remove old Handlebar Grips
        </h2>
        <p>
          To remove old grips you may have to cut them off,<br />
          but you can probably get them off by sliding a screw driver under them and spraying some WD40<br />
          or anything else that will let the rubber slip off.
        </p>
        <p>
          Honda CG125 Front Disc brake model.<br />
          The only big problem was getting the handle bar end weights off the bike (round metal weights at the end of the handlebar).<br />
          The screws were so tight (probably glued on in the factory) I could not use a normal screw driver;<br />
          I also needed a tool to hold the round metal weight still.<br />
          I had to use a plumbers water pump pliers to hold the round metal weight<br />
          (I put some cloth between them but still managed to scrap some black paint off).<br />
          Luckily my socket set had a screw driver bit that fitted and an adapter to fit the ratchet handle,<br />
          so I had much more leverage than a normal screwdriver.<br />
          I do not know if someone helps you, if you could use another set of pliers on a normal screw driver instead to get the leverage.
        </p>
        <p>
          The throttle side grip was not glued on; it was wrapped over a plastic ring at the end furthest away from the handlebar end.<br />
          I simply pulled it off without any tools or any liquid.
        </p>
        <p>
          The clutch side grip was only glued on at the furthest end from the handlebar end,<br />
          I had to use some liquid (I used WD40) and a screw driver to remove it.<br />
          I pushed the screwdriver under the grip at the end that used to have the handlebar weight,<br />
          I then sprayed a little WD40 around the screwdriver,<br />
          and I then moved the screwdriver around the inside of the grip and sprayed some more WD40.<br />
          I kept doing that until the entire inside of the grip had WD40 on it.<br />
          Even though the screwdriver did not reach all the way down the grip, gravity let the WD40 run down it.<br />
          The WD40 lubricated the rubber and made it slippery; it also dissolved some of the glue,<br />
          so the grip became very easy to pull off.
        </p>

          How to put on new Handlebar Grips
        </h2>
        <p>
          You need to clean the handlebar (maybe the throttle as well) before you can fit new grips.<br />
          Especially if you put something slippery on to remove old grips.<br />
          Cleaning will also remove any glue or deposits left from the old grips.<br />
          You can use petrol / white spirit or turps to clean (dissolves glue and removes slippery chemicals and deposits),<br />
          but make sure it has totally evaporated off (I would wipe it as well) before trying to fit new grips.
        </p>
        <p>
          Motorcycle grips have a different internal size for the clutch side compared to the throttle, the throttle side is much larger.<br />
          You can buy special Grip Glue, but it really is not necessary.<br />
          Hairspray works just fine and I bet you will not be able to tell any difference.
        </p>
        <p>
          Spray loads of hairspray (I use the strongest version) inside the grips (along the whole length and all the way around).<br />
          Every single part of the inside of the grip that touches the handlebar or throttle must be soaking wet in hairspray;<br />
          else the grip will not slide on (too much resistance).<br />
          Then immediately (within seconds) push (will need to twist and force it) the grip on to the handlebar or throttle,<br />
          before the hairspray has a chance to start drying.<br />
          If you find it's too hard to slide on, spray more hairspray in to the grip,<br />
          you may even need to spray a bit on to the handlebar or throttle.<br />
          If you still have trouble, you probably still have some of the old glue / deposits left on from the old grips<br />
          (so clean it again and more thoroughly).
        </p>
        <p>
          When you have got the grip on to the handlebar or throttle, you should find it will slide around for a while,<br />
          use this time to get it in exactly the right place and straighten it up if it looks twisted (depends on grip style).
        </p>
        <p>
          The hairspray will take hours to fully evaporate, leaving a small amount of glue behind.<br />
          I would always leave it overnight or just in case 24hrs.<br />
          The grip will then not slide at all on the handlebar or throttle.
        </p>
        <p>
          The grip does not actually need any glue to stop it sliding on the handlebar or throttle,<br />
          it just needs something to help it slide on (which totally evaporates).<br />
          Hairspray is often used by people fitting handlebar grips and that's what I use, things like petrol may damage the grip.
