          The basic fault finding below will fix almost all the common faults your likely to get with the bike.<br />
          Just like the <a href="servicing.htm">Servicing</a>, it's very easy for anyone without any skills to do and it's much cheaper than a
          mechanic.
        </p>
        <p>
          A worn out Battery is the most common fault, it's also one of the easiest faults to find and fix<br />

        <p>
          Mechanical faults often affect the fuel to air mixture entering the combustion chamber (engine).<br />
          If the air is restricted you will get a rich mixture,<br />
          if the petrol is restricted you will get a lean mixture,<br />
          if you get a hole (could look like a crack or slit)<br />
          in a pipe or rubber which results in air from outside being sucked in you will also get a lean mixture.<br />
          If the mixture is to rich or lean it will ether result in bad engine performance (and other side effects)<br />
          or if really bad it will stop the engine from working.
        </p>
        <p>
          A spark plug colour chart will show you how the engine has been running, normal, rich, lean or other problems.<br />
          Look at the Normal, Overheated and Carbon Fouled pictures in the link below.<br />
          <a href=
          "http://www.verrill.com/moto/sellingguide/sparkplugs/plugcolorchart.htm">http://www.verrill.com/moto/sellingguide/sparkplugs/plugcolorchart.htm</a><br />

          For more Spark Plug information, see <a href="#Spark-Plug">Spark Plug</a> section below.
        </p>
        <p>
          An explanation of how carburettors (carbs) work and how they change the mixture at different throttle positions<br />
          can be found in this link <a href="http://www.iwt.com.au/mikunicarb.htm?pli=1">http://hondanighthawks.net/carb14.htm</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          A Colortune is a very useful device that lets you see inside the combustion chamber (engine)<br />
          and see the colour of the flame (rich / lean / normal mixture), please see my <a href="colortune.htm">Colortune Review</a>

          <a name="Petrol" id="Petrol"></a>Petrol
        </h2>
        <p>
          See <a href="servicing.htm#Ethanol-in-Petrol-Warning">Ethanol in Petrol Warning</a><br />
          Also see <a href="general.htm#Petrol">Petrol</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Petrol ages, if it's old petrol it can cause trouble, there are also bad batches from time to time,<br />
          try to dilute it with fresh petrol or drain and replace it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some petrol brands and versions have more inbuilt cleaners in than others.<br />
          Shell V Power, BP Ultimate, Tesco 99 are more expensive than normal Unleaded Petrol, but they have extra cleaners in them.<br />
          If the engine is able to work, using petrol with extra cleaners in over time may slowly clean the carburettor and engine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over a long time a petrol tank can build up rust, sludge and dirt inside. This normally settles in the bottom of the tank.<br />
          The petrol tap is fed by 2 pipes from the tank;<br />
          reserve petrol tap position is a shorter pipe and so feeds from petrol lower down the tank.<br />
          So if reserve petrol tap position does not work try the main petrol tap position.
        </p>
        <p>
          Only do all of the following in the Petrol section below if you're sure the fault is nothing else in this page.<br />
          If the bike falls over or if the petrol tank is shaken excessively the rust,<br />
          sludge or dirt could float up and then block the main or reserve pipes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The petrol tap has filters that can become blocked with rust, sludge or dirt that must be cleaned (only if they become blocked).<br />
          Switch petrol tap off.<br />
          Unscrew the bottom of the petrol tap and remove the filter.<br />
          Clean the filter in petrol, if there are any holes in the filter replace it.
        </p>
        <p>
          If that fails to work you will need to drain the petrol tank.<br />
          To drain the tank remove the rubber petrol pipe, switch the petrol tap to reserve position and let it drain in to a container.<br />
          When the petrol has drained out,<br />
          get rid of the old petrol since it will be contaminated from the contents of the petrol tank (it cannot be flushed down a toilet).
        </p>
        <p>
          Remove the petrol tap from the petrol tank by removing the nut between the tap and the tank.<br />
          Inspect both petrol tap pipes and clean thoroughly in petrol<br />
          (there probably are filters on the end of each pipe that need cleaning).
        </p>
        <p>
          You then need to clean the inside of the petrol tank, petrol is a good cleaner.<br />
          It's probably best to remove the petrol tank,<br />
          remove the left hand side panel of the bike,<br />
          unclip the right hand side panel where it clips in to the petrol tank (some bikes do not clip in to the petrol tank),<br />
          unclip the petrol tank electrical connection (only bikes equipped with a fuel gauge have an electrical connection)<br />
          and un hook the electrical wire from the bikes metal frame,<br />
          remove the seat (see <a href="servicing.htm#Remove-Seat">Remove Seat</a> part in <a href=
          "servicing.htm#How-to-find-your-bikes-Tool-Kit-and-Owners-Manual">How to find your bikes Tool Kit and Owners Manual</a>
          section of the <a href="servicing.htm">Servicing</a> page),<br />
          remove the bolt holding the tank, then remove the tank by pulling it towards the rear of the bike and up.
        </p>
        <p>
          If all of the above fails to fix the fault, the carburettor will need to be cleaned,<br />
          search the internet or get a Haynes Honda CG125 manual to find out how to clean it.<br />
          A universal motorcycle carburettor cleaning guide will do, you do not need Honda CG125 carburettor cleaning instructions.<br />
          On the internet enter motorcycle carburettor cleaning in to your favourite search engine.<br />
          Cleaning a carburettor is not an extremely difficult job but you have to be careful,<br />
          if in doubt find someone who has done it before or ask a mechanic to do it.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you need to take the carb (carburettor) off,<br />
          do not undo the nuts that hold the carb to the intake manifold rubber,<br />
          since the carb if over tightened can change shape and will not make a good seal, so will cause a week mixture.<br />
          Also as you push the carb back you have to use a great deal of force against the air box rubber<br />
          which will damaged / split it which will cause a week mixture.<br />
          The way to take the carb off is to undo the manifold bolts (8mm bolts)<br />
          on the cylinder head and then the carb comes out / back easily (engine must be cold when this is done).
        </p>
        <h2>
          <a name="Oil" id="Oil"></a>Oil
        </h2>
        <p>
          Check the oil level (see <a href="oil.htm">Engine Oil</a> page), if it's burning oil the level will drop, you need to see a mechanic if
          it's substantial.<br />
          Make sure you change the oil at the correct mileage or before (see <a href="oil.htm">Engine Oil</a> page).
        </p>
        <h2>
          <a name="Spark-Plug"></a>Spark Plug
        </h2>
        <p>
          Check the spark plug (see <a href="spark_plug.htm">Spark Plug</a> page),<br />
          look at the colour, this tells you how the engine is running, see <a href="#Basics">Basics</a> section above for a link to a colour
          chart.<br />
          If it's running rich (black sooty deposits = Carbon Fouled) clean the air filter.<br />
          If it's running lean check the Exhaust and Silencer (see Exhaust and Silencer section below),<br />
          it could also be a fuel starvation (blocked) fault in the <a href="#Petrol">Petrol</a> line or carburettor.<br />
          When choke is on the mixture will be rich.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's always a good idea to change the spark plug and see if it fixes the fault.
        </p>
        <h2>
          <a name="Air-filter"></a>Air filter
        </h2>
        <p>
          Clean it (see <a href="servicing.htm#Air-Filter">Air Filter</a> in <a href="servicing.htm">Servicing</a> page), it's always a good idea
          to clean the filter and see if it fixes the fault,<br />
          this would cause the engine to run rich.<br />
          If there are holes in the air filter or if the engine is run without an air filter, the engine would run lean or not at all.<br />
          It's very bad for the engine to run without filtered air.<br />
          See <a href="#Basics">Basics</a> section above for more information and links about rich or lean running.
        </p>
        <h2>
          <a name="Exhaust-and-Silencer"></a>Exhaust and Silencer
        </h2>
        <p>
          If the Exhaust or Silencer has rusted all the way through it will make the engine run lean or rich (probably lean).<br />
          You must replace it, be careful with non-Honda parts unless it says it will not change the mixture of the engine (rich / lean).<br />
          If you fit a non Honda part you may have to alter parts inside the carb to get the mixture correct at all throttle positions.<br />
          Make sure any parts are designed for your version of Honda CG125.
        </p>
        <p>
          See <a href="#Basics">Basics</a> section above for more information and links about rich / lean running and the carb.

        <p>
          Clutch or Gearbox faults can often be due to <a href="clutch_cable.htm">Clutch</a> free play, <a href="chain.htm#Chain-Tension">Chain

        </p>
        <p>
          If the clutch has done a very high mileage or has been severely mistreated over its life and so needs to be replaced,<br />
          I very highly recommend you put the EBC brand of clutch plates and clutch springs in (see <a href="general.htm#Clutch">Clutch</a> in
          <a href="general.htm">General</a> page).

          <a name="Valve-Clearance"></a>Valve Clearance
        </h2>
        <p>
          Check the valve clearance (see <a href="valve_clearance.htm">Valve Clearance</a> page).<br />
          If the valve clearance is wrong, some of the problems are, engine performance / power may reduce,<br />
          it can make the engine run rich or lean, reduce engine compression,<br />
          make it hard to start or if it's very wrong valve or engine damage may occur.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the valve clearance is too big, you may hear excessive noise from the valves.<br />
          If the valve clearance is too small, you may hear no noise from one of the valves; this is very bad for the engine.<br />
          The noise test should not be relied on; you should only rely on the <a href="valve_clearance.htm">Valve Clearance</a> page.

        </h2>
        <p>
          If you have a Honda CG125 before 1995 (before S &amp; T models) it could still have the old Points system.<br />
          See <a href="servicing.htm#Ignition-Timing">Ignition Timing</a> in the <a href="servicing.htm">Servicing</a> page.<br />
          Just like the Valve Clearance, the Points need to be checked and adjusted.<br />
          The Points affect the timing of when the spark plug fires. It also varies the timing dependant on engine revs.<br />
          If the timing is wrong the power will reduce from the engine.

        <p>
          The Air Suction Valve is only fitted in countries that require it to reduce emissions,<br />
          the UK and most of Europe did when the front brake went from Drum to Disc.<br />
          The Air suction valve is on the left hand side of the bike just under the petrol tank. <a href="images/rubber_pipe.jpg">Picture</a> (ignore

          another pipe connects it to the air filter<br />
          and another pipe connects to the metal pipe between the carburettor and the engine.

        <p>
          Air is sucked from the Air Filter in to the Exhaust valve which is on top of the engine;<br />
          this enables the excess fuel in the exhaust gas to be burned in the exhaust.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Air Suction Valve is actually 2 valves; both valves need to be open for air to flow from air filter to exhaust port.<br />
          One opens when there is negative pressure on the exhaust valve<br />
          (that's when fumes are sent out of the engine in to the exhaust).
        </p>
        <p>
          The other valve is open all the time except when there is negative or low pressure<br />
          in the pipe connecting the carburettor to the engine.<br />
          Negative pressure is generated when closing the throttle and decelerating, the valve must close to prevent after burning.<br />
          Low pressure for example is generated at high engine revs;<br />
          the valve must close to prevent a loss in performance due to Exhaust Gas Recirculation.<br />
          I'm guessing a fault creating Exhaust Gas Recirculation does not sound good<br />
          if the exhaust gas ends up in parts not designed for the heat or fumes (air suction valve, air filter etc.).
        </p>
        <p>
          It looks like you disable the Air Suction Valve by disconnecting the pipe going to the valve cover (on top of the engine).<br />
          You then bung up the pipe and tie it tight to stop air flowing through the pipe.<br />
          The UK MOT still may not check the exhaust emissions of motorcycles (check first), cars have been checked for many years.<br />
          I'm not sure, but it's probable that disabling the valve will not improve engine performance unless the valve is faulty,<br />
          people who guess it would may be thinking of the Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) valve system<br />
          which always reduces engine performance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Someone told me their Air Suction Valve stuck open,<br />
          the bike juddered at around 5500 rpm and could not get past 6000 rpm in any gear, see <a href="mph_to_rpm.htm">MPH to RPM</a> page.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you disable the Air Suction Valve I am not sure if it would change the air mixture (lean or rich),<br />
          it might at all or some throttle positions?<br />
          It could well be that it does not since you have to disable the valve (close it) when you do an emissions check.<br />
          You can find out by checking the spark plug colour,<br />
          see <a href="#Basics">Basics</a> section above for more information and links about rich / lean running and the carb.

          <a name="Serious-mechanical-engine-fault"></a>Serious mechanical engine fault (not easy to do, only for mechanical enthusiasts)
        </h2>
        <p>
          In the unlikely event that your engine has developed a serious fault that cannot be easily or cheaply fixed,<br />
          a common solution among Honda CG125 owner's<br />
          is to simply buy a 2nd hand Honda CG125 engine from a scrap / salvage yard or from ebay.
        </p>
        <p>
          The idea seems very easy for anyone without any skills to do, unbolt old engine and disconnect it from everything,<br />
          then put 2nd hand engine in and connect everything to it.<br />
          That would work if it's the same exact version of Honda CG125 engine, but often things slightly change over the years.<br />
          You also need to be happy buying a 2nd hand engine and trust that it's ok.
        </p>
        <p>
          The engine is affected by the carburettor, exhaust / silencer and air filter.<br />
          Examples,<br />
          if the air filter is changed for one that has more resistance the engine will run rich (less resistance = lean),<br />
          if the exhaust / silencer is changed for one that has more or less resistance it will run rich or lean.
        </p>
        <p>
          The carburettor is what can change the engine from running rich or lean (it's actually called the fuel to air mixture).<br />
          The carburettor has to change the settings at different throttle positions<br />
          (you need to check the fuel to air mixture is correct at all positions).<br />
          See <a href="#Basics">Basics</a> section above for more information and links about rich / lean running and the carburettor.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you put an engine with an Air Suction Valve in to a bike that does not support it or the other way round<br />
          (bike is designed for an Air Suction Valve, engine is not),<br />
          you might be wondering what to do with all the pipes and connections.<br />
          Have a look at the <a href="#Air-Suction-Valve">Air Suction Valve</a> section above to find out what it does and how to disable
          it.<br />
          I would seal off any pipes and connections they connect to.

        <p>
          If a light bulb fails, you must fix it as soon as possible, you would fail a police check and a MOT in the UK.<br />
          Never ride in the dark without a working headlight.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the bike is very old the bulbs will be 6 V (volts), if it's a modern bike it will be 12 V (volts),<br />
          the bulb and battery will be marked with 6 V or 12 V.<br />
          If you accidentally put a 6 V bulb in to a 12 V bike the bulb will probably just burn out immediately<br />
          (bright flash of light then it never works again).<br />
          If you accidentally put a 12 V bulb in to a 6 V bike the light output will be half what it should be.
        </p>
        <p>
          Headlight, if the low beam fails, use the high beam instead,<br />
          you can point the headlight down to stop it blinding other vehicles.<br />
          Legally you must still replace the bulb as soon as possible (see <a href="servicing.htm#How-to-replace-the-Headlight-Bulb">How to
          replace the Headlight Bulb</a> in the <a href="servicing.htm">Servicing</a> page).<br />

          Rear Brake light,<br />
          if it does not come on when the rear brake is applied,<br />
          there's an adjustment wire,<br />
          it's vertically mounted and has a spring connecting it to the pedal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Push the brake pedal down and up to find it (the cable and spring will be moving);<br />
          there's an adjustment screw in the middle of it.
        </p>
        <p class="under-img">
          The indicator bulbs (probably 16w) and the rear light / brake bulb are probably standard bulbs that all cars and bikes use.<br />
          Rear light and brake light are probably combined in to a single dual filament bulb,<br />
          one filament for rear light (5w) the other for brake light (21w).
        </p>
        <p>
          Left and Right Turn Indicators, there's a fuse (see <a href="#Fuses-Connectors-Wires">Fuses</a> section below) and a small box that
          makes the indicators flash.<br />
          Low battery voltage can make the flasher malfunction so check the battery first,<br />
          see <a href="#Battery">Battery</a> section below. If it's a low voltage fault it should recover with full voltage.<br />
          The indicator relay / flasher box could be around the battery,<br />
          under the seat or be the black box where the <a href="idle_screws.htm#Idle-speed-screw">Idle Speed Screw</a> is (see <a href=
          "idle_screws.htm">Idle Screws</a> page), don't touch the idle speed screw.<br />
          The box will be a standard indicator relay / flasher unit,<br />
          you could probably buy a universal one, maybe even a car one<br />
          (if you have a 12 volt system, look at battery to find out).<br />
          But I would see how much a genuine Honda one is.<br />
          Indicator relay / flasher devices have 2 or 3 electrical connectors;<br />
          try to buy one that's as similar as possible to your original one.

        <p>
          Check the fuses, they are around the battery (behind the bikes left hand side panel),<br />
          see if any are blown and there should be spares with them.<br />
          Front Disc Brake model has<br />
          20A Fuse; this powers the engines electric starter motor and is also the master fuse.<br />
          5A Fuse, this powers the left and right turn indicators.<br />
          15A Fuse, this powers everything else including the electric starter motor button.
        </p>
        <p>
          If moisture gets in to any electrical connections or wires (usually were the connectors touch the wire) in the bike,<br />
          they can corrode (rust), this increases the resistance for electricity (drops the voltage) and can even break the connection.<br />
          If you have this problem, you need to find it,<br />
          check any connections you can find and also look at the wire where it connects to the connector.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you know how to solder, cutting off the connector and any corroded wire<br />
          then soldering instead is much better, since solder seals the join from moisture and dirt.<br />
          Of course if you are bad at soldering, you can create what's known as a dry joint,<br />
          this will corrode internally and break the connection.
        </p>
        <p>
          For people who do not know how to solder, you can do the following.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the fault is with the wire, you will have to cut off the connector,<br />
          then cut off all the corroded part of the wire (usually that's only the bit without plastic around it),<br />
          then take a bit of the plastic off the wire, then try to reuse the connector or buy a new one.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the fault is a corroded connector, you can use a normal can of WD40<br />
          (available at most motor shops, DIY and even supermarkets).<br />
          But only use WD40 if the connector is corroded, WD40 cleans,<br />
          removes water and eats corrosion (over time), but leaves a deposit that attracts dirt.<br />
          This deposit may help the connection to begin with, but later dirt could break the connection,<br />
          you can then put more WD40 on and if the corrosion is gone, wipe off the WD40 as much as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          On old bikes the electrical wires can become stiff and brittle.<br />
          There are several electrical wires that go to the headlight and the front indicators.<br />
          Every time you turn the handlebars<br />
          these wires are stretched and bent around the part of the bikes metal frame (chassis) that the handlebars attach to.<br />
          Eventually these wires can break and even short out, blowing the fuse.<br />
          The battery's - (negative = maybe brown or black wire) connector is wired to the bikes metal frame,<br />
          the headlight and front indicator wires are likely to have worn the paint off the bikes metal frame<br />
          and so any + (positive) wires can short out if their insulation is worn away<br />
          and they touch any unpainted part of the bikes metal frame.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some electrical devices on the bike do not have a - (negative wire)<br />
          instead they connect to the bikes metal frame to get the - voltage.<br />
          When corrosion / rust builds up between them it can reduce the voltage or even break the connection.

          Low battery voltage affects all the electrics, including the spark plug.<br />
          To test for low voltage, switch the ignition key on, while the engine is off try the horn,<br />
          if the tone is much lower than normal, you have low voltage.<br />
          You can also do this test with the lights, if they are dimmer than usual with the engine off, you have low voltage.<br />
          Of course a standard cheap voltage meter (multimeter) is far easier to use and far more accurate.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the engine will not start due to low battery voltage and you need it started soon,<br />
          try switching off the ignition for a minute or two.<br />
          If that fails to work you could try bump starting the motorcycle (may or may not work).<br />
          I have never bump started (push started) a motorcycle but I believe the technique is the same for all bikes.<br />
          Sit on the bike (I do not recommend you try this off the bike, you could drop it),<br />
          switch the ignition on, put the bike in to 2nd gear and keep the clutch pulled in,<br />
          then move the bike forwards with your feet as fast as possible,<br />
          the faster the bike is moving the more likely the engine will start and stay running so try to go downhill<br />
          or ideally get a person to push the middle of your back at least at jogging or ideally running speed,<br />
          then let the clutch out smoothly and quickly, when the engine starts pull in the clutch.<br />
          If that fails to work you may have to open the throttle a bit just before or when you release the clutch,<br />
          if that fails you may have to try the bike in 3rd gear.<br />
          To get the bike in to 3rd gear you may need the bike to be moving at the time.<br />
          Someone made a video of them bump starting a Honda CG125<br />
          (looks like an electric start only version with low battery voltage) 
		  <a href="http://youtu.be/JrWcjsNpCTQ">Push Start Honda CG125 Video</a><br />
          A more detailed video of how to bump start a different bike

        </p>
        <p>
          An electric start Honda CG125 needs a massive amount of power (voltage and current)<br />
          to start the engine (battery needs to be healthy and fully charged or nearly fully charged).<br />
          A failing battery might seem to have enough voltage but when the electric start is used<br />
          the voltage can drop significantly resulting in the engine not firing up.<br />
          The electric start may turn the engine over (might be slower than normal),<br />
          but then the battery may not have enough voltage left to ignite the petrol at the same time.<br />
          It may not even have enough voltage to turn the engine over and you only hear a click instead.<br />
          If you have a kick-start as well, try it since it needs far less power than an electric start.<br />
          As soon as you take your finger off the electric start button the battery may return to a good voltage.<br />
          The Front Disc brake Honda CG125 automatically cuts off the front headlight briefly<br />
          when the electric start is used (this is a deliberate design feature and not a fault).<br />
          Some Honda CG125 electric starter motors have failed<br />
          (they just go click and do not turn the engine over even though the battery is fine),<br />
          I believe they fail due to black dust building up inside,<br />
          all you have to do is remove the starter motor and clean its insides.<br />
          The starter motor is the round cylinder underneath the choke lever, someone made a video 
		  <a href="http://youtu.be/-oovP9hJT6Y">Part 1</a>&nbsp; 
		  <a href="http://youtu.be/FUFD0xWCGms">Part 2</a>&nbsp; 
		  <a href="http://youtu.be/9Yy5UWdw-bc">Part 3</a><br />
          Some people have got the starter motor going by hitting it with a hammer instead.<br />
          There is also the possibility that the engine just needs to turn over once or twice<br />
          (with ignition off, put the bike in to 2nd gear and turn the back wheel by hand in the forwards direction, not reverse).
        </p>
        <p>
          There are several reasons for low battery voltage.<br />
          1. It's simply worn out, this is by far the most likely.<br />
          2. If it's a maintenance battery, see <a href="servicing.htm#Battery">Battery</a> in the <a href="servicing.htm">Servicing</a> page.<br />
          3. You have left it for months and so it has gone flat (all bike batteries loose charge over time so charge it).<br />
          4. You have been doing loads of very short journeys and it has not been able to recharge enough<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (not so likely if you use a kick-start).<br />
          5. The engines battery charger has stopped working or the fuse / wire connecting it to the battery has failed.<br />
          6. You have an alarm fitted and it has drained the battery.<br />
          7. You have left the lights on (if your model has that ability).
        </p>
        <p>
          Testing the motorcycles battery charger is probably easiest by simply replacing the battery,<br />
          if the new battery suffers low voltage with use, it must be the motorcycles battery charger.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can test the battery with an automatic battery charger,<br />
          see the section below called <a href="#charge-battery-and-detect-if-worn-out">How to charge a battery and detect if it is worn
          out</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can test the battery, but you could also just replace it.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have a voltage meter (a cheap multimeter will do) you can do some basic tests.<br />
          When the engine has been off for at least 1-2 hours with ignition key turned off,<br />
          100% Charged 12.60 to 12.8v<br />
          75% Charged 12.4v<br />
          50% Charged 12.1v<br />
          25% Charged 11.9v<br />
          0% Charged less than 11.8v
        </p>
        <p>
          When the engine has been off for at least 1-2 hours,<br />
          Switch ignition key on and switch the headlight on<br />
          (the engine must not be running, some Honda CG125 headlights only work with the engine running),<br />
          you need at least 11.5v on a 12v battery or 5.75v on a 6v battery.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the engine is running the bikes inbuilt battery charger should raise the voltage well above 13v<br />
          especially when the engine revs are well above idling.<br />
          You need at least 13.2v to start recharging a 12v battery,<br />
          only when the voltage gets close to 14.0v will it be charging well.<br />
          Above 14.5v a maintenance free battery will be damaged (voltage can go even higher if the bikes charging system is faulty).<br />
          A maintenance type battery can handle up to 18v,<br />
          bikes designed to use this sort of battery can often have a charging system that supplies up to 18v.<br />
          A failing battery can drag the bikes inbuilt battery chargers voltage down<br />
          (also a flat battery will drag the voltage down far more than a full battery).<br />
          But also a failing bikes inbuilt charger can drag the voltage down,<br />
          increase it or even fail completely and so not charge the battery at all.

        	You can upgrade from a Yuasa YTX5L-BS to a Yuasa YTZ7S which is the same size on the outside.<br />
			    (to be exact it is 1mm smaller in height, width and length). But is 6Ah and 130 CCA.<br />
			    Honda dealers may be far cheaper than others for this battery since they may have a special contract through Honda UK.<br />
			    I hope to be able to try it sometime, so far I have always used my original 2005 Yuasa YTX5L-BS.

		    <p>
          After a lot of research, it appears the only brands of battery's which are widely known and have a decent reputation,<br />
			    are Yuasa, GS, Varta, Motobatt and Exide. GS is in fact part of Yuasa the company name is GS Yuasa.
			  </p>
		    <p>
        	I highly recommend you do not install a Gel or Lithium motorcycle battery,<br />
			    since they are probably not compatible with the motorcycle's electrics as well as many other problems.

          The Front Drum brake Honda CG125 electric start bike probably uses<br />
		      the same battery as the Front Disc brake model mentioned above.
		    </p>
		    <p>
          An electric start needs a large amount of current (measured in CCA) to start the engine.<br />
		      So the 70 CCA (cold crank amps) mentioned above is very important, especially in winter.<br />
		      Some battery brands on the market claim to be the equivalent of the Yuasa YTX5L-BS,<br />
		      but are only 55 CCA. These battery's may be around half the price of a 70 CCA Battery,<br />
		      but they are not the same battery technology. The TX part of the model number stands for VRLA,<br />
		      or a more exact name is AGM. The AGM battery technology is much more advanced.<br />
		      It results in a much higher CCA, recharges much quicker and lasts many more years.<br />
		      Since the manufacturer of the motorcycle fits a AGM battery as standard,<br />
		      it is a very bad idea to try and fit a non AGM battery,<br />
			    unless you have an alternative to using the electric start, especially in winter.
		    </p>
		    <p>
          The CCA of a battery is sometimes very hard to find. It is not normally printed on the battery.<br />
		      But it should be in the battery manufacturers catalogue.
		    </p>
		    <p>
          A kick-start only Honda CG125 needs much less current to start the engine so a cheaper battery technology is used.<br />
          Front drum brake kick-start only model and 12 Volts probably<br />
		      uses a Yuasa YB2.5L-C or Yuasa YB3L-A or maybe another model, but they are all maintenance type battery's.
		    </p>
		    <p>
          Front drum brake kick-start only model and 6 Volts probably uses a Yuasa 6N6-3B (6V 6Ah conventional maintenance)
        </p>
		    <p>
          When buying a new battery, you need the details of the old one.
        </p>  
		    <p>
          The voltage should be on the battery and on every light bulb; it will be 12V or 6V.<br />
          A 12V battery has 6 compartments (6 filling holes), 6V only has 3.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the model number is no good you will have to find the following on the battery.<br />
          The most important thing is the voltage and the capacity.<br />
          There have been many different versions of Honda CG125 over the years<br />
          and the voltage and capacity required has changed several times.<br />
          The next thing you need is the physical size of the battery, height, width and depth to make sure it fits.<br />
          Then you need to know which way round the + and - connections are.<br />
          If it's a maintenance battery,<br />
          you need to make sure the plastic breather tube is in the correct place or it's supplied with a longer one that will fit.<br />
          Maintenance Free batteries have no plastic breather tubes since they are sealed.<br />
          Of course the battery compartment of the bike might allow<br />
          a different size of battery and plastic breather tube (if the battery has one).<br />
          There are different battery terminals requiring different connectors<br />
          (sometimes a new battery comes with new connectors to put on the bikes wires).
        </p>
        <p>
          A new battery will come with an instruction leaflet, if you need to pour the acid in to the battery read it,<br />
          it will tell you to stand the battery for at least 30 minutes after pouring the acid in (before charging).<br />
          It may tell you to tap the battery to get the air bubbles out<br />
          and pour more acid in if the level drops on a maintenance type battery.
        </p>
        <p>
          A new battery is semi charged when assembled (probably 80% charged),<br />
          for maximum performance and life it should be fully charged with a charger before being put in to the bike<br />
          (see <a href="#charge-battery-and-detect-if-worn-out">How to charge a battery and detect its worn out</a> below).<br />
          A shop or you can charge it, but it takes time.<br />
          After charging for the first time,<br />
          if it's a maintenance battery the fluid levels must be checked,<br />
          ideally you should pour battery acid in if needed, but only use acid after charging for the very first time with a new battery.<br />
          After that you should not use acid. See <a href="servicing.htm#Battery">Battery</a> in the <a href="servicing.htm">Servicing</a> page for
          more details.
        </p>
        <p>
          When fitting a maintenance battery, you must connect the plastic breather tube,<br />
          it needs to point down and away from the bike, this is usually in the middle of the bike, just in front of the rear wheel.<br />
          This tube may have corrosive gasses and liquids pouring out, so do not let it point at anything other than the ground.
        </p>
        <p>
          The battery terminals and any exposed (bare metal, not plastic) metal wires connecting to them,<br />
          need to be protected from the corrosive gasses from the battery, this might not apply with maintenance free batteries,<br />
          but it definitely does for maintenance batteries.<br />
          You can put any type of grease over them to protect them, you can also buy special grease for this, but there's no need.<br />
          Make sure you do not get grease between the battery terminals and the connectors,<br />
          unless the grease is designed to allow voltage to pass through it.

        </h2>
        <p>
          Using the correct battery charger is crucial to prevent the battery from being overcharged and permanently damaged.<br />
          Most motorcycle and car batteries are now Maintenance Free type (you must only use the type your vehicle is designed for),<br />
          this means you cannot top them up with water (distilled or ionised).<br />
          Overcharging boils the water in the battery which then escapes,<br />
          as the water level drops in the battery the performance will drop until the battery becomes useless.<br />
          Overcharging happens when the voltage goes above 14.5V.<br />
          Overcharging will also happen if the voltage is above 13.9V for excessive lengths of time with a fully charged battery.<br />
          That's why most modern battery chargers<br />
          will ether switch off or drop the voltage below 14.0V to stop the battery from being overcharged.
        </p>
        <p>
          You must also be careful about the charging current,<br />
          too much current will overheat the metal plates inside the battery,<br />
          which will permanently twist and distort them (severely damaging the battery).<br />
          A battery is meant to be charged with a current that's 10% of its capacity (size),<br />
          for example a 4 Ah battery would need 0.4A of current.<br />
          You can charge at a higher rate but it will harm the battery,<br />
          20% is acceptable, 30% is the absolute limit before real damage is expected.
        </p>
        <p>
          You also have to be careful with modern quality battery chargers<br />
          which automatically tests the battery to see if it's refusing to charge.<br />
          If it thinks it's refusing to charge it will try to force (recover) it with up to 20V for a short time.<br />
          It is crucial if you have one of these chargers that it's designed to work with your battery capacity (size),<br />
          the chargers user manual should specify which battery capacity's it will work with.<br />
          If your battery is below the minimum capacity,<br />
          the charger will probably think it's refusing to charge<br />
          and so will try to force it with up to 20V every time you put it on charge (which is very bad for the battery).
        </p>
        <p>
          There are many battery chargers available.<br />
          Some have a switch or mode for motorcycles and another for cars (since their batteries are larger).<br />
          Others do not and are designed for ether car or motorcycle batteries only.<br />
          It's crucial to choose a battery charger that claims to work with your size of battery.<br />
          It's also important to check it charges at a maximum of 14.5V (14.4V and 14.3V are also ok).<br />
          As well as the charging current<br />
          (if the charger has a car / motorcycle switch or mode it will supply a higher current in car mode than motorcycle).
        </p>
        <p>
          I have seen a car / motorcycle charger that supplies 2A current in motorcycle mode (that's far too much).<br />
          Another car / motorcycle charger that only supplies 0.8A current in motorcycle mode (that's ok),<br />
          but claims to only work with 7Ah batteries and above,<br />
          since it has a force (recover) automatic mode I would not dare use it on batteries below 7Ah.<br />
          I have even seen some battery chargers that are so basic they have no fixed voltage.

          Oxford Battery Chargers (reading reviews on Amazon, it appears this brand has reliability problems)
		    </p>
		    <p>
          Well known quality Battery Chargers in the motorcycle and car world.
        </p>
		    <p>
          Optimate is the original modern battery charger brand in the motorcycle world.<br />
		      They allow a few companies to put their own brand on their chargers like Honda and Triumph motorcycles.<br />
		      But you will always see the Optimate brand on them as well.<br />
		      Optimate 1 has 0.9A current output, Optimate 4 has 0.8A current output.<br />
		      Optimate 2 has 0.8A current output, Optimate 5 has 2.8A current output (do not use on motorcycle battery's).<br />
		      Optimate 3 has 0.6A current output, Optiamte 6 has 5A current output (do not use on motorcycle battery's).
		    </p>
		    <p>
          Ctek is the original modern battery charger brand in the car world.<br />
		      They allow their battery chargers to be rebranded with other peoples brands.<br />
		      But they are identical in every way to a Ctek charger, the only difference is the label on the top.<br />
		      Yamaha motorcycles put their brand on them and many car manufacturers and others do as well.<br />
		      Their cheapest model should have 0.8A current output.<br />
		      All other models are at least 3.6A (which is far to high for motorcycle battery's),<br />
			    but if they have a motorcycle mode it will switch the charger down to 0.8A.
		    </p>
		    <p>
          Yuasa Battery Chargers (900mA = 0.9A, 600mA = 0.6A, 300mA = 0.3A current output).<br />
			    Yuasa YCX range are rebadged Ctek.<br />
			    But they also make their own range of battery chargers that are much cheaper than Optimate or Ctek.<br />
			    They are much cheaper because they do not have all the advanced recovery modes for severely neglected battery's.<br />
			    But they are still very good reliable battery chargers<br />
			    and may even charge healthy battery's more fully than Ctek or Optimate.<br />
			    Yuasa Yu-Power 12v 900mA Motorcycle Battery Charger model number YPC09A12MC, is widely available (ebay etc..).<br />
		      In some country's there is a Yuasa Smart Shot 900 model instead.<br />
			    The following Yuasa models are harder to obtain, try putting their model numbers in to Google to find suppliers.<br />
			    They do not have the correct attachments for motorcycle battery's, but you can easily adapt them.<br />

          Honda CG125 electric start models<br />
          use a maintenance free 4 Ah battery<br />
          so the ideal charging current is 0.4A = 400mA (that's 10% of the capacity).
        </p>
        <p>
          Honda CG125 kick start only models<br />
          probably use a maintenance 2.5 Ah battery<br />
          so the ideal charging current is 0.25A = 250mA (that's 10% of the capacity).
        </p>
        <p>
          To charge a battery, you must disconnect at least one of the battery terminals from the bike.<br />
          This is to stop the battery charger damaging the bike's electrical system.<br />
          The negative battery terminal is often hooked up to the bikes metal frame,<br />
          so it's best to remove the positive battery terminal (Red wire),<br />
          since if the battery charger accidentally touches the metal frame,<br />
          it would send the battery charger voltage through the bikes electrical system<br />
          if only the negative terminal was disconnect.
        </p>
		    <p>
          Some modern battery chargers like Ctek, Optimate and Yuasa,<br />
		      may claim you can use them without disconnecting the battery from the bike's electrical system.<br />
		      That may be true. Many people use them like that and have no problems.<br />
		      The battery chargers unlike others, have special components inside to smooth out the power.<br />
		      If anything goes wrong with these special components or you have a mains surge (e.g. lightning strike),<br />
		      there is still a possibility your bikes electrical system may be damaged.<br />
		      The only reason I can see for charging a battery like that is if an alarm is fitted to the bike.<br />
		      An alarm can dramatically shorten the life of a battery unless a charger is switched on all time.
		    </p>
		    <p>
          Some modern battery chargers claim you should leave them switched on all the time,<br />
		      for weeks and months in order to increase the battery life.<br />
		      Other people would argue doing that will decrease the battery life (unless you have an alarm fitted).<br />
		      One thing is for sure, if anything goes wrong with the battery charger (due to a fault or lightning strike),<br />
		      it can easily kill the battery and can even cause a battery fire or acid to pour out of the battery.<br />
		      The chances are that will not happen, but you will be wearing out the battery charger.
		    </p>
        <p>
          An automatic battery charger will tell you when the battery is fully charged,<br />
          a faulty or worn out battery will probably never reach fully charged.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have a very old Honda CG125, your battery may be 6 V (volts) instead of the normal 12 V,<br />
          if it's 6 V you need a battery charger which is or can switch to 6 V.<br />
          If you have a 6 V battery, all of the bikes electrical system and everything that connects to it will be 6 V;<br />
          do not change it for a 12 V battery since it would destroy everything.<br />
          All batteries will have a label on them stating if they are 6 V or 12 V, if the label has worn off,<br />
          all the light bulbs will also state if they are 12 V or 6 V.<br />
          6 V maintenance batteries have only 3 compartments to top up with water (distilled or ionised),<br />
          12 V maintenance batteries have 6 compartments.
